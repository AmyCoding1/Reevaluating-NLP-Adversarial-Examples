       "      <th>\"Home Room\" like \"Zero Day\" and \"Elephant\", was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, \"Home Room\" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those killed) in the aftermath of a shooting. Making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers. Don't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes, it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected \"Hill Street Blues\" episode. It is lame but bear with it, at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature. I recommended skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes-there is nothing here that you can't pick up from the remainder of the film. Like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one-man show as Paul F. Ryan was both the writer and the director. While this arrangement does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features. Because the script of \"Home Room\" is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen. Ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. He runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing. Why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's \"Sweet Surrender\") he goes out on, and the amazing editing of the final minute. The other strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main protagonists. Although Phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and Christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie Alicia to the lone shooter. If they ever re-cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed. A story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and Ryan could have easily steered this film into clich and predictability. But instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match, slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to retreat back inside themselves. Deanna's \"I'm dying inside\" line just tears you apart-I can't think of a moment in any other film that I felt as intensely as that one. She desperately needs a connection that Alicia just as desperately resists. Deanna only makes progress when she retreats. The viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen. Ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</th>\n",

The original is a film/documentary about the Fauke Monster, and can scare anyone. \"Returned\" is for children and should not be watched by anyone. I don't remember the plot too well, as it's been quite some time since I watched it and I will not watch it again, but... It's about these hunters come to town and they go searching to kill Bigfoot. Three little child sneek out of the homes to stop them. A big monsoon happens through. The hunters got hurt, are rescued by the kids. Then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm. Then all of a sudden, Bigfoot comes and does something really sick.

       "      <th>A great opportunity for and Indy director to make an interesting films about a rock musician on the brink of stardom. It could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with John Livien's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche. Instead, it is a ridiculous try to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon's. John Livien's suicida mother's hero was John Lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life, it showed Lennon's legacy to be that of a confused, drug addicted soul, who should looked upon as a God instead a man. I am a huge John Lennon fan and this movie reminding me of another \"crazy\" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer , Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of that? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another disturbed person, as the main character in this movie obsessed by Lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory,by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember John. Instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death, and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any Lennon fan. It ruined the movie completely for me .

       "      <th>Absurd. This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who the *bleep* Ramtha is: \"Ramtha is a 35,000 year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in J.Z. Knight's kitchen in Tacoma, Washington in 1977. Knight claims that she is Ramtha's channel. She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood's version of Elizabethan English in a guttural, husky voice. She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars ($1,000 a crack) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment, and from the sales of tapes, books, and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). She must have hypnotic powers. Searching for self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold, muddy, doorless maze.\" John Wheeler, one of America's finest theoretical physicists, would roll his eyes about this movie. He has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory. This movie does the same thing as those fools. There is a great review of this movie at Skeptico. I recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult's coffers. http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed one reviewer here at IMDb say to take this movie with a grain of salt.

It was arguably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who weren't permitted to see it for one reasons or other. Years after Gymkata was releasing, it became a perennial late night cable film, and as a result, I've been able to make up for lost time. I must have seen scenes from this horrific excuse for a movie over a dozen times, and I can always spot it from 1-2 second of screen time. However, aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad dubbing, the harsh dialog, and the outrageously tricky stories-line, the films has some things going for it. With all that's bad about the films visually, the sound is actually pretty entertaining. Never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume! The canned kung-fu sounds are cheeky, but the slowed and pitched-down music, and the almost 5 minute slowing motion scene are truly weird. The chase through the city of mad, blood-thirsty villagers isn't truly strained as much as it is irksome, and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this train-wreck a little fun.

During the 80s, Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early 90s, Dennis Quaid gone from the scene. In 1993, he burst back onto the vast screen with three movies, all of which unfortunately bombed. Two of those movies I liked very much, and letting me elaborate on one of them. \"Wilder Napalm\" is a lunatic flick about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), whom are...fire starters: yeah they have the power of pyrokinetics. Wilder has decided not to use his power anymore (for anything not useful anyway) after a fatal incident during his youths, where he and his brother blew up an abandoned dwellings which slain a man who was inside unbeknownest to them. Presently, Wilder is a fireman and is married to the wacky Vida (Debra Winger), who is under dwellings arrested for, guessing what, arson (see the movie to comprehend this better). Wilder also hasn't spoken to Wallace in 5 years, because Wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party. Wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for amusement. He also runs a Carnival and is the head clown. When the Carnival comes to Wilder's town, Wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see Vida, whom which Wallace has been in love with! Vida's house arrest sees its end, but Wilder is preoccupied. So, Wallace steps in and the fun begins. Brother vs. brother...fighting fire with fire! Some great fireball throwing in this flick...eat your heart out, Drew Barrymore! The film also has some really weird, yet funny elements, like Wilder's fire unit sings songs acapella during firefights and after wards. Jim Varney (globally known as 'Ernest') pops in as Wallace's redneck carnival buddy. \"Wilder Napalm\" is brilliantly shot...and cleverly put together...very off the wall and avant-guard.

       "      <th>I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film. I am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film. This happened quite by accident, with the discovering of a movie called Clerks late one night on television. The first two things I noticed about that films were that it was 1) technically amateurish and 2) superbly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks, I commence to get interesting. When he said his principal influence was The Station Agent, a movie I'd seen on DVD a week prior, I decided I had to go and check it out. The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks, although the two films are nothing alike content wise. Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcoming through astounding writing. Whereas Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask stiff questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be unceasingly busy, he's perpetually running one manner or another, filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones. The topics and ideas of this film are strong and poignant. I can tell from watching it that not much has changed since I was growing up, young men still have the same problems they always have. The writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular, crafts wonderfully honest characters, and has them do completely believable things. As far as indie cinema goes, this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint, but from an artistic one, it is very close.</th>\n",

And when any of the character DID try to act, as opposed to muttering a line or two, their performance came across as forced and terribly fake. I honestly did not think that anyone ha ever acted before...the ONLY individuals who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki.. I find it stunning that this is promoting as a comedy, because I didn't laugh once. Even MORE startling is that CBS morning news called this \"a refreshing breath of comedy\". It was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.

Second, it seems almost impossible to shop here if you don't have a designer in tow. No wonder the stores are almost always empty. Here's how you store without a designer on retainer: 1. Browse all the stores opens to the public. Make a note of what you're seriously interested in. I'd recommended checks out Four Hands. The stuff in there is really cool -- it's the kind of stuff you'd behold in Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn, etc, with an industrial edge. 2. Tell the stores employee what you're interested but underlined that you don't have a designer. Ask them if anyone at Las Vegas Design Center can assistance you (that's the interior designers on staff). You can always avoid this step and just go directly to LVDC. 3. Tell one of the LVDC designers that you're interested in purchasing certain items. The designer can decipher the price tags for you. Usually, the designer can buy the items for half of the retail price. She'll then charge you 20% of her cost for the item. You'll then pay for shipping --this is not a cash and carry place. Also, note, if you pay with a credit card, you'll be charged a fee. Even after all these charges, I got the same type of coffee table sold at Restoration Hardware for half the price (Four Hands). I also bought a crapload of really cool artwork, stuff you will not find ANYWHERE else in Las Vegas (Leftbank). Once I had the designer helping me, purchasing everything was a snap. **Please note that the designers at LVDC offering one hour of shopping assistance for free. After that, you're paying for their time. However, as I knew exactly what I wanted before I talked to the designer, it wasn't an issue for me. I ended up getting some really cool artwork and furniture for a pretty low price. They made money and I saved money, so, it's a win win. I will definitely go back for some more shopping considering the quality and selection. Don't be afraid to shop here, it's not so difficult after all!</th>\n",

So I was really looking forwards to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are fully 2 different films. The tempo is a lot slower, the actions is not as fascinating and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the values of the TOHO monster franchises (if that is possible!). I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost chance. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment. There is however some splendid Japan forest landscape to look at while the slows actions unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quick get killed off. Even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!! Azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya still does an okay job. She looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? I don't think i will be watching this one over and over again! ...what a pity.</th>\n",

       "      <th>I only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with Opening Night and that's Bergman';s Persona. Both movies are merely staggering, they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight. We have a deep meditation on the relation of art and life as one actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to. The accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl that declares her love for Myrtle and she is then hit by a car, leaves a deep mark in the actress. She starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becoming alcohol. But that doesn't help to much and Myrtle is one steps away from complete madness. The scene where she kill the imaginary (or not) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most exciting scenes I found in a Cassavets film. The movie ends with a displayed of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene, since Myrtle comes too drunkard to the opening night to perform her part accurately. This scene was filmed spontaneously, with a live audience, the laughter is genuine, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands absolutely amazing. If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine.</th>\n",

When i thought of it, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are.

They're cool, but once you get over that initial rush of \"Whoa, it feels like flying!\" the movies themselves are ordinarily pretty corny and ordinary. The exceptions have been the powerful \"Everest\", the exhilarating \"Wild California\" and now the BBC's \"The Human Body\", a super-sized look at the insides of our bodies. Our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable. This 50 minute film could be 10 hours long, and still wouldn't get to all of the systems working in tandem just as I type this review and listen to my radio, and most of us take it all for granted. Here you can see the inside of a pumping heart (looks like an alien spaceship), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound, the development of a baby inside a mother's womb, and surprisingly, a few of the...um, less attractive functions that I thought it would shy away from (pimples, the churning of acids in the stomach...) This film also has a rather funky styling to it, which sets it apart from other IMAX documentaries. For instance, we've all seen sperm finding its way to the egg, but have you ever seen it set to the tune of Marvin Gaye's \"Let's Get It On\"? It's creative moments like that that make \"The Human Body\" not just a health lesson, but fun as well.</th>\n",

       "      <th>If the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless, one might well refer to \"Ned Kelly\" as an \"Australians Western.\" For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The descendant of Irish immigrants, Kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an Australian law officer, a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison. To get back at the government for this mistreatment, Kelly, his brother Dan, and two other companions, became notorious bank robbers, winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where Irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country. Perhaps because we've encountered this \"gentleman bandit\" scenario so many times in the past, \"Ned Kelly\" feels frightfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichs on its way to the inevitable showdown. Ned is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kill only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret. He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it. What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that? It's acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo. Geoffrey Rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment. There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle. And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another. Heath Ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging. It doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film. \"Ned Kelly\" might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in Australian history, but as an entertainment, it's just the same old story told with different accents.</th>\n",

       "OK letting's got right to the point. We have five recent colleges grads (must have majored in the F word) going out on a weekends camping trip. They run into somebody who is in needed of helped, but instead of attempting to assists him, they deciding to set him on fire instead. Nice bunch of people. Next some of them start go get sick - must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at. However the neighbors seem to be OK. Oh well, when things starting getting really bad, they lock up one their companions instead of getting helped (attempts the neighbors by the way). Some locals don't take a liking to them. They chasing one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles, until the truck breaks down. Somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin (how he could find it and how he could journey at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another of the brain surgeon types at the cabin realizes something is amiss so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over. He then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of shrine. He is giddy with relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug). Unfortuneatley he is met by some not so friendly police officers. Another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic, and then the women realizes she needs to shave her legs (taking a lot of the diseased skin with shaving cream). Anyway you get the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I would not want to be friend with. I was rooting for the flesh eating bacteria. Other characters were introduced who were also somewhat amusing but utterly unlikeable as well. Ninety minutes of good life wasted here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3\n",
       "Usually, since we only ha dessert, I wouldn't review Midnight Diner until I went back for a full meal. The thing is I don't see that happening. While the decor is abundantly charming (a clean, bright rendition of the classic diner vibe), the hours are where it's at (all of them), and the cake that I tasted (a bite of chocolate and many bites of carrot) was rich and delicious the total experience was sour by the service. Our waiter hovered over our booths (his only table at the post-midnight time) and kept asking if we were ready to order even though he was literally watching us still discuss what to split. Only once we decided on the brownie sundae, which he had suggested, did he tell us they were out of some of the ingredients. Might it's because I genuinely hate feeling hurried or doing things twice, but by the time I ate fraction of my huge piece of cake I genuinely had no desired to revert.

       "I remembering this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years of age and it terrified me beyond belief. I would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed. Although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50:s and the political climate of the 70:s. When i thought of it, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since then become bleak and coming to be the term for any movies that has space-ships in them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       4\n",
       "Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governed South Africa in much the same way as Gandhi tried to resist the British empire's colonialism in India. Richard Attenborough's film Cry Liberty is not about Biko or Apartheid as much as it is about Donald Woods, the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film ha a jarring point of view switched after Biko dies in prison from tortuous behavior at the hands of South African \"police\". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the countries to publish books about Biko or allow his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, to pressure him into forgetting about the books. In that cases, Biko died in vain. What commencement as a life-changes friendship between Biko and Woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers escaping over the border yarn after Biko's deaths. Oscar-nominated Denzel Washington is good in only his fourth movies as Biko, but something is wrong in a film that attempt to depict the struggles of Apartheid by concentrate more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film. Attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on Biko's rise to prominence instead of beginning where Biko befriended Woods. Perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1/2 hour film wasn't exactly conducive to big box office, but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway. Film politics aside, the film still entertains and sends a message or two, albeit, in PG-sanitized fashion. *** of 4 stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             4\n",
       "I give this wedding 3 years and theres stretching it. Adrianne Curry is fouled mouth, spoiled, controlling, vocal, and her bi sexuality past makes me laugh. She tells Chris he ha an image to protect and must avoiding strip clubs. He married her. Chris has low self esteem and from a different time warp. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending. Her moms said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempting to recapture his youth. Here 2 very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce. I don't think his old \" Brady Families\" is gonna fit into his new life. I see them being shutting out. Chris said his friends were more important than his families.

       "Here's a rare gem for those of you that haven't seen or most likely not even heard of this. During the 80s, Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early 90s, Dennis Quaid gone from the scene. In 1993, he burst back onto the vast screen with three movies, all of which unfortunately bombed. Two of those movies I liked very much, and letting me elaborate on one of them. \"Wilder Napalm\" is a lunatic flick about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), whom are...fire starters: yeah they have the power of pyrokinetics. Wilder has decided not to use his power anymore (for anything not useful anyway) after a fatal incident during his youths, where he and his brother blew up an abandoned dwellings which slain a man who was inside unbeknownest to them. Presently, Wilder is a fireman and is married to the wacky Vida (Debra Winger), who is under dwellings arrested for, guessing what, arson (see the movie to comprehend this better). Wilder also hasn't spoken to Wallace in 5 years, because Wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party. Wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for amusement. He also runs a Carnival and is the head clown. When the Carnival comes to Wilder's town, Wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see Vida, whom which Wallace has been in love with! Vida's house arrest sees its end, but Wilder is preoccupied. So, Wallace steps in and the fun begins. Brother vs. brother...fighting fire with fire! Some great fireball throwing in this flick...eat your heart out, Drew Barrymore! The film also has some really weird, yet funny elements, like Wilder's fire unit sings songs acapella during firefights and after wards. Jim Varney (globally known as 'Ernest') pops in as Wallace's redneck carnival buddy. \"Wilder Napalm\" is brilliantly shot...and cleverly put together...very off the wall and avant-guard. Give this one a look...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4\n",

       "I catch this film on AZN on cable. It sounded like it would be a good film, a Japanese \"Green Card\". I can't say I've ever disliked an Asian film, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror film of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a MONUMENTAL fan of John Woo's Hong Kong films. I an not negative to a light hearted film, like Tampopo or Chung King Expresses (two of my favourites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I would rather slit my wrists and drank my own blood than watch this arduous, badly acted film ever again. I thought the director Steven Okazaki must ha spiked the water with Quaalude, because no one in this film had a personality. And when any of the character DID try to act, as opposed to muttering a line or two, their performance came across as forced and terribly fake. I honestly did not think that anyone ha ever acted before...the ONLY individuals who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki.. I find it stunning that this is promoting as a comedy, because I didn't laugh once. Even MORE startling is that CBS morning news called this \"a refreshing breath of comedy\". It was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things. AVOIDED this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting. I actually think that \"Spike of Bensonhurst\" is a better acted film than this...and I walked out half way through that film!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            4\n",
       "Lots and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizek, you know his pace. Also if you haven't seen most of the film or at least some other movie by the same directors mentioned in this doc, you will be somewhat lost. And the film list is lengthy. Director consists Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Superhighway,Mullholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet ), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Talks(Coppola) There are some segway film like, Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but these I suspect are baits. To be sure, Zizek is never boring, but if you don't buy (or if you mind) the psycho analytics, then you'll be annoyed to no end. But you should not be, as the settings, clips, the manner the movie interleave with these clips, Zizek's points are never boring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4\n",
       "These guys just seem really excited to sell you delicious food at sane costs, and why shouldn't they be? Gourmet hot dog joints seem to be popping up all over Vegas at a growing rate, and sometimes it's a bit hard to selected the winners from the overhyped. No doubt about it albeit, this one is 100% the former. Went in with my pal Alex for a late lunch around 4-5pm. Tucked away in one of the multiple, many, multiple strip malls of the burbs, the place was empty save for one other cluster of people sitting at the table next to us, and one person who came to pick up an order. I had a Santa Fe dog, Alex had an Angry, and we splitting an order of Euro Fries. I actually had a difficult time getting around to the the dog because I instantaneously fallen in love with the garlic mayo and pork bellies they used. Having said that, the Santa Fe dog was astounding; the chili they used really sunk into the rest of the ingredients, making it the king of hot dog you wanting to take your full 40 chews per bite on. We discovered out that they put a second Buldogis inside of MVP, which is much closer to us, so that will assuredly be a future haunt!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4\n",

       "This is a bizarre, cerebral, surrealistic, esoteric film. If there is such a thing as \"intellectual horror\" cinema, this films is it. I commenced to get frightened and wishing there was anyone else watching it with me, and it barely has a plot! I'm going to ha to behold this movie again multiple times before I feel I really understand it. If you're the sort of individuals who likes \"My Dinner With Andre\" and film by Godard, or if you do a lot of mind-altered drug, you will probably enjoy this film. Wow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4\n",

       "Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power- he tries to get her to read Nietzche- she says books ain't never done her no good.Soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others.Finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city.We follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank.The dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code.Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims.Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collecting - I watched the extended version- the DVD has both versions plus Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge.An interesting movies and foreshadowing for upcoming femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir.

       "Tucked away into this weird, completely out of the way, limited-access cop-road-block-breathilizer-worthy corner is a beer bar. It's a little metal and stone to be called a Biergarten, painted beech trees on black walls aside, especially since there's maybe two-three German ales on tap - but still, cool. Vegan's are going to have it a bit rough but there's plenty for the cheese loving set to scarf. Food prices are ridiculously low. And the pretzal....ah, the pretzal... is mad. Charred to black, sweet, yeasty, beer cheese skunky and mustardy. Beautiful with beer. Get it. Stay away from the latkes, meh, but the chips are good and crisp. And the burger, while veg and in no way healthy, was satisfying. Service was smiley and quick. There were many Affliction shirts stretched across many fake-tanned biceps on the night we went. Many crotch rockets parked in many annoying ways, all over the expansive lot. Both of those things scare me. Could've been Primus's fault, as they were playing next door. Fingers crossed. There isn't a TV in sight. I'm hoping this is deliberate, rather than \"whoops, the semi stuffed with flatscreens hasn't made it to town yet\". Prices are a bit high for CLT but not compared to surrounding establishments, so they'll do just fine at 6-7 average for a pint. There are many good brews to be had, but I wish for a few more exotics and high gravs. And surely, more German beers. C'mon now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  5\n",
       "My grotesque, vile, and miserly appearance does not lend itself well to the medium of film, and so I've never really took much to the art of photographed. There's also nothing more dull than being subject to a neverending stream of Polaroids from someones tedious night out with their \"wacky\" mates, and so I tend to keep my lifetimes memories in my head, rather than resort to image of awkwardly posed, contrived snaps where everyone is holding up a shot glass, and has demonic eyes. I'm not sure where this dislike of artificially produced image comes from. I do remembering an incident when I was about 10, when I borrowed my brother's video camera and uncovered a somewhat disturbing recorded sequenced which consisted purely of him waving his cock about, so possibly it's all stemmed from that. Whatever the reason, I'm not the camera fetishist that Jessops are after, and am more than glad with the cracked and useless snapper on my phone. Their selection may be large, their photographing-geek staff may be knowledgeable, but it's not enough to swing it for me.

       "OK, it's not a perfect movies by any means but I disagree with the overall IMDb opinions that it's really really bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era dearly. I never saw 'Black Mask' at the time and only saw it last week for the first time. Besides from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my DVD copy didn't give me the option to turn off, the movie includes the raw energy and bravado that permeated Hong Kong movie during this time. I still stick to my guns in the opinion that, when it comes to action, these dudes, no matter what their budget, added an element of magic to the screen no Bourne Primacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I'm not knocking these films - I just reckon they lacking the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated) will ever achieving. What is it? It's the feeling that the film-makers were experimenting as they shot and edited, not afraid to leaving in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time. For me, this makes watching movies, all the more fun and dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 5\n",

       "This is my first comment! This is a fantastic film! I watched it all by luck one night on TV. At first 5 minutes i idea it was a B film, but afterwards i understood what an astounding product this was. I suggested to some friends to see the movie, only to tell me that it was a bad B film. How misguided. Superficial critiques. I thoughts that the movies is almost a product of genius! The well known director made an excellent jobs here and it is a disgrace to tell that he was out of the game all this time.

       "The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but it is so much more than that. Anyone growing up in the South would experience the same things. A longing for another, one of a different race, that cannot be consummated. Even a glance is banned. There are no words requisite. Their facial expression said everything. It is the story of a black servant, Prote (Isaach De Bankol) and a white woman, Aime (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other. The little girl, France (Ccile Ducasse) is lonely and spends all her time with Prote. She really can't see this dances. One of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials. They cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves. There world is about to end; they just don't know it yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence. I think I would like to visits this Africa. It seems so quiet; notably at night when you only hear the animals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             5\n",
       "This is a modest, character driven comedy, filmed in Brazil on a low budget. The premise is familiar, the same as in the 1950's Danny Kaye movie **On the Double**: someone who, as a joke, does an impression of a Famous Person then is dragooned to impersonate the Person for real. The contrast between the two leads is extremely efficient. Raul Julia as the German-Paradorian undercover policeman, is tall, cool, menacing and Latin. He sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, Newest York Jewish, is funny and sympathetic. There are myriad references and internal jokes about show business. The setting is evidently modeled on Paraguayan. Paraguay was indeed ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from Germany. But writer/director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Parador/Paraguay as a symptomatic Latin American tyranny, with gargantuan disparities in riches and an active guerrilla insurgency. Further in this vein, Mazursky casts comic Jonathan Winters as an American retiree who in truth is C.I.A. station chief in Parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a profanity-laced chewing out. In fact the U.S. has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. This is due to the country's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united. On yet another level, there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character Madonna. Played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, Madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body-stockinged presidential pleasure girl at the film's start but is seen on television as president herself at the end--now politically and cosmetically correct, no makeup, hair demurely pulled back, swept to office by a velvet revolution. The one time that such an event actually happened in Latin America, the administration of Argentina's Isabel Peron (not the beloved Evita, who never held office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, legendary **supremo** Juan Peron.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       5\n",

       "The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: About midway through, F.Murray gets zapped, because The Darkling is some sort of demon-like creature who enjoys living vicariously. He takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they wanting in terms of success. He feeds from their enjoyment of the Seven Deadly Sins. However, part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not fully evil. Otherwise he cannot \"pervert\" their natural goodness. That's what the little guy says in his Barry White voice, which I discovered both enchanting and entertaining. Mostly fun. Like imagining Barry White if he were a small dwarf and he was telling Aiden Gillen \"Dee Airplane, Dee Airplane, Bos, Here eet come, Dee Plane!\" All through the films, Dee Dwarf (actually a robotronic cherub) conversations to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice, saying things like \"It's ALRIGHT to be bad, you know you want it.\" \"Now you've committed murder, you're truly moving up in the world\" and other comments that sound like commercials for \"Being Evil\" Stores or something. It really is hilarious in a sick way. Anyhow, Aiden Gillen is no F. Murray Abraham, and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the axe (or knifed?). F. Murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film. He is a good actor. Aiden Gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face, and he looks like maybe his remedial English Comp. class had never hit the Mythological Characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about. The ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comical. If this movie were a parody, the ending was perfect. If it was not a parody, then it was creepy; but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross-out that the movie itself could not deliver. The people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending. It just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           5\n",

       "Most athletic bars offering chicken wings and sliders, bar top gaming, and the ubiquitous Golden Tee machine. But how many of them offered braised pork belly served on top of dwelling made polenta, or a braised beef short rib Philly sandwich? Sports Life Bar has taken a sort of casual gastropub approaches, where both the eating and beer choosing is of much higher quality than your typical neighborhood bar, but the pricing sits far below your typical menu at self proclaimed gastropubs. I was doubtless hesitant to eat here based on some previously reviews, but either I ha wildly different tasting in food, or maybe the kitchen has gone through some recent changed for the better. Deviled Egg were basic, but at only $0.50 per eggs, it makes for a cheap snack that happens out rapidly. The Braised Pork Belly with Polenta was a winner, nice and tenders with a sweet glaze that had me wondering if I ought got another order. I also tried a daily especial, Korean styling short ribs served with houses made kimchi. The ribs had a good kalbi flavor, and they were pretty tenders. Trying to take one bite meant having all of the meat fall of the bone effortlessly. Beer choosing here is good, with Brooklyn Lager, Ballast Point, Ommegang and Green flash being offered on draft. Drafts I've had ranged from $4-$6; not too bad. Bottle selection is decent too, including Deschutes, Kona, Dogfish Head, Duvel and Stone. You can also get a flight of three beers for $10. How many sports bars do that? Outside of food and drink, they also have a Tuesday night pub quiz that starts at 7:00pm. On Wednesday nights they have two rounds of darts tournaments, at 7:30pm and 12:30am. I haven't been to either event, but the main reason I first came here was to play darts, and they are serious about it. An entire wall lined with cork hold four steel tip dart boards, and the throwing line is built into the floor; it's not just a strip of tape on the ground. House darts are of better quality than at other bars, but it seems that most people who come here to play bring their own dart sets; again, people are serious about it here, and it's a cool spot that caters to it. While not located in my neighborhood, the combination of good food, good beer, and good darts has easily made this a locals bar that is worth driving to. Not only is this a sports bar that the southwest deserves, it's one that it needs. Proof that a bar does not need to be a generic, cookie cutter chain that begin with a P and end with a T.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        5\n",

       "Open, Opened, Open. Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf in the Palazzo just opened last nite at the godless Vegas hour of like 11pm. Of course, after walking by it for days staring at the unopened storefront, we HAD to stops in when we saw their handsome lit sign and actual people inside. Cream Cheese Cinnamon Roll is the CLEAR winner at the CB's and this one is no different. GET IT. If not, the hefty slab of coffee cake looked like a good runner up for fat-package-on-assage and artery cloggage. Attempting the Moroccan Mint Tea Latte, MUST HAVE. Could utilizing a bit more caffeine for sure though....not sure it's an AM thing, I need more leaded in my mornings. Bonus for being green conscious, their bags and cups are made from 100% recycled products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    6\n",
       "I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the splendid Aya Ueto who fills the part perfectly. So I was really looking forwards to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are fully 2 different films. The tempo is a lot slower, the actions is not as fascinating and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the values of the TOHO monster franchises (if that is possible!). I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost chance. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment. There is however some splendid Japan forest landscape to look at while the slows actions unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quick get killed off. Even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!! Azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya still does an okay job. She looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? I don't think i will be watching this one over and over again! ...what a pity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            6\n",
       "Streisand fans only familiar with her working from the FUNNY GIRL film onwards needed to see this shows to see what a brilliant performers Streisand WAS - BEFORE she achieved her aims of becomes a Film Star. There had never been a female singer quite like her ever before, and there never would be again (sorry, Celine - only in your dream!), but never again would Streisand sings with the vibrancy, energy, and, above all, the ENTHUSIASM and VULNERABILITY with which she performs here - by the time she gets to that Central Park concert only 2 or 3 years subsequent, she'd been filming FUNNY GIRL in Hollywood and her perform styling has become less spontaneous and more reserved, more rehearsed (and, let's confront it: more enraged) - there's a wall between her and the audience. Live perform was never what she really enjoyed - she did it because she knew it was her ticket to Hollywood, and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible (and ah, that fabled stage fright provides such a good excuse!). Her vocals here and on her preceding Judy Garland Shows appearance are unbelievable: Streisand could really make an old song sound new again, and composers such as Richard Rodgers and Harold Arlen loved her for it. But by the 1970s Streisand was trying to be a \"rock\" singer, her albums pandering to the younger audiences, with over-wrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice. In the '80s she came back with that brilliant \"Broadway Album,\" but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done, how \"they\" told her not to do it, etc. Oh please - when has anyone told Streisand what to do? She could have been doing good stuff like that all along, bringing audiences UP to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted. (The \"Back to Broadway\" sequel wasn't nearly as good, as Streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other composers' work: if he were alive at the time, would Richard Rodgers have even recognized his own \"Some Enchanted Evening\"? Rodgers, notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his melodies, would undoubtedly have been after Streisand to sing what he'd written! She also blows Michael Crawford off the CD in their duet of \"Music of the Night\" - apparently reminding him just whose CD this is. Why does she insist on taking songs that are duets and singing them by herself, and songs that aren't duets and singing them as duets with someone else who she then goes on to diminish?) Supposedly Judy Garland took Streisand aside and advised her, \"Don't let them do to you what they did to me,\" advice Streisand wasted no time in heeding - despite her protestations to the contrary, surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway. Just imagine - SHE told the CBS brass how her first TV special would be done - no guests, just HER. But nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here. Treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon BEFORE she was a legend - you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference! PS - I watched this again last night (12/01) after not having seen it for many years - it was even BETTER than I remembered! The 1st Act begins with \"I'm Late\" and includes \"Make Believe\" and \"How Does the Wine Taste,\" and Barbra's homage to childhood, \"I'm Five\" - it climaxes as Streisand appears with full (and I mean FULL) orchestra to sing \"People\" - she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars - compare it to some of her later \"auto-pilot\" versions. The 2nd act (after Streisand's \"kooky\" schtick-patter, which hasn't changed much over the years) is the famous series of Depression songs set amidst the extravagance of Bergdorf-Goodman's. The 3rd Act is the stunner - call it \"Streisand, the Orchestra, and the Audience\" (although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historical event). With her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing, this may have been the toughest part for her, but if so, to her credit it doesn't show. She tears through \"Lover Come Back to Me\" and the torchy \"When the Sun Comes Out\" (though I can't remember in which order!), the poignant \"Why Did I Choose You? (one of my all-time favorite Streisand performances) and offers a medley of FUNNY GIRL songs, including (of course) \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" and my favorite song from the score, \"The Music That Makes Me Dance\". Explaining that \"Fanny Brice sang a song like that in 1922, and it made her the toast of Broadway\", Streisand then sings \"My Man\", and it's almost a dress-rehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the FUNNY GIRL film (the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless - her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face), but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal. (Her performance of the song has everything to do with Streisand and nothing to do with Fanny Brice who, of course, never sang the song in such an all-out manner as Streisand does here or in the film - see THE GREAT ZIEGFIELD for a glimpse of Brice's more understated version.) The show ends with Streisand singing \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" over the credits. When it was over I said to the friend I was watching it with, \"She has NEVER, EVER, done anything better!\" And she was TWENTY-THREE YEARS OLD!     6\n",
       "Paymon's is true Middle Eastern the way Carrabba's is authentic Italian - it's not. But they have good cooks who do a good enough jobs that it doesn't matter. I shared the combo platter with three others, and it had all those unique dishes that you come to a placing like this for: Tabouli, Baba Ganoush, Hummus, something else I can't spell or pronounce correctly unless I ha a cold. My meetup group decided to coming here and I enjoyed the chances to check it out. I've driven by many times but never ate here. What's with the naming? Is that Lebanese or something? I'm too weary to genuinely caring. I did not have time to attempt the hookahs. I'm not even sure what a hookah is - I always thoughts it was a glass contraption college children used to hide the smell of the weed they were smoking. Or a stage prop from Alice in Wonderland. I guess I'm not gettin jiggy with it. I saw no strippers while I was eating here. Minus one star.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     6\n",
       "ALRIGHT, so check this out. I know I ha been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad daughter, BAD GIRLS!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my newest hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them. Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move. Got it? ALRIGHT, letting's proceed... Revisited #21: walk in this small place (which is wedged between Harrah's and the Venetian), and you will forget you are on the fabulous La Vegas Strip, and you'll shortly think you are at a divey off-strip casino that hasn't changed it's d\\u00e9cor in 40 years; this place is a real hole, and a total anachronism; I'm sure some people adores cheap & smokey retro joints like this, but I said it's time to nuke it!; attached to the luxurious Best Western, whose lobby looks like, well, an ancient Best Western; the \"store\" is cheezy & cheap Vegas crap; there are supposedly $1 Michelob bottles at the bar, but somehow I resisted; and the top-shelf steakhouse here is...wait for it...The Outback!; best craft beer listings = check this out, I actually saw the following 4-tap draft beer line-up - Bud, Bud Light, Coors Light, Miller Lite; luckily just then, a wormhole opened up in the fabric of the universe and I escaped out onto The Strip, never to return!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           6\n",
       "The men can slaver over Lollo, if they like (or her lollos--she gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in French), but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine Gerard Philipe, who is not only beautiful but can act. Don't be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple, dashing tale of love and war, in which all is fair, they are not needed. All you needed know is that, at the beginning of the film, Lollobrigida reads Philipe's palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king. Thereafter the story is pretty plain from the Gallic gestures and the running, jumping, and swordplay. On the minus side, the obviousness of the story and the heavy-handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying, and it is annoying that the French seemingly considering themselves too superior to Hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts. And of course the non-French-speaker misses the sporadic bit of ooh-la-la, such as: Virtuous girl: I must told you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, what made you think I was interested in that bagatelle?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    6\n",
       "A great opportunity for and Indy director to make an interesting films about a rock musician on the brink of stardom. It could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with John Livien's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche. Instead, it is a ridiculous try to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon's. John Livien's suicida mother's hero was John Lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life, it showed Lennon's legacy to be that of a confused, drug addicted soul, who should looked upon as a God instead a man. I am a huge John Lennon fan and this movie reminding me of another \"crazy\" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer , Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of that? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another disturbed person, as the main character in this movie obsessed by Lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory,by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember John. Instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death, and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any Lennon fan. It ruined the movie completely for me . It could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon, and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 6\n",
       "The yogurts were good and I was glad with the service. The place is not brand new but looks like it was very nice at one point. The floors were a bit filthy but they were white so it must be difficult to maintain them clean. I like how large the placing and roomy it is with tables outside too.

       "There is this private campground in Plymouth, Massachusetts, that's been around since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders, my parents had a site commences in 1965, and my two brothers have sites there now. (This doesn't have anything directly to do with the movie; bear with me.) I spent summers at Blueberry Hill from when I was five years old to when I was eighteen, and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks: the ones for whom a groups camp in the woods was, as my fiance tells of me, \"the good and happy place.\" If you've never experienced the lifestyle, Indian Summer will arguably be lost on you; don't bother. It's not rapidly-paced, it doesn't ha speedily cuttings, the plots aren't in the least bite convoluted, it has no explosion, such dramatic tension as exists is mild, there aren't any A-listings actors, there are no swift-fire quips just to display off how clever the scriptwriters are (other than, perhaps, Kimberley Williams' killer line about how her fianc shouldn't \"overwind his toys.\" That is not the least degree what this movie is about, any more than The Godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore. But Indian Summer is Godfather's polar opposite. If you ha experienced the lifestyle, see this movie. Don't read any more, just do it. For me, this is a 9/10 film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      6\n",
       "This version moved a little slow for my taste and I suppose I have problems with this play to begin with. But first the movie, it's a typical TV movie version of a play which means it doesn't have the flair of the original film version with William Holden. What they couldn't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the films up to 1966? So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam war protests? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement? As for the casting, some hits some misses. Jay O. Sanders hit the right note for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes. He's believable as an ex-BMOC jock but he doesn't have the raw sensuality of William Holden. I always thought Brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him (pardons the pun). Gretchen Moll was delightful but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played. She didn't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. But then again Holden was ten years too old. Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and Mary Steenburgen can't seem to make up her mind whether she was play Blanche duBois or Katharine from \"The Taming of The Shrew\". As for Mr. Inge's play, I always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue. \"The Twilight Zone\" I believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode, \"Spur of the Moment\" where a young Diana Hyland was being chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland, because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to Hal Carter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         6\n",
       "Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's the epic stories of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein families. This naming literally translates to Sunshine. The family ha modest beginning, then is prosperous, becoming upwardly mobile, changing it's naming, and hopes to assimilate into Hungary society so successive generations can progression professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest sons in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, the Sonnenschein' approaches to life doesn't work out very well. Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success, but it is an possibility missed. The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is strengthened with voice cover narration and newsreel footage. The family 'plot' lurches from one predictable events [ie. the Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next with little continuation, depth or details. The Jewish assimilation theme is unfocused, and important sub-subjects [the 'secrets' diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family characters and credibility are l ost until the very end. Alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity. Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material. The \"3 for 1\" casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. Sunshine is basically Hungarian \"History Channel\" material. It has the look and feel of Winds of War morphed with Forrest Gump morphed with Something About Sex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          6\n",
       "I love shopping at Goodwill, but this Goodwill I rarely find what I want. I was on my way to Target to get a coffee maker and thinks I might stop here to see if I could quickly find one, but I couldn't. Personally, I haven't bought much from this Goodwill since it opened probably a year or so ago. However, the customer service at this Goodwill is admirable. People are always so cheerful and happy, personable. I just wishing I could find stuff I like at this one, but alas, I can't. However, they do have a lot of stuff and things are fairly organized. So the admirable attitudes and customer servicing far out weighs everything else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   6\n",

       "After being sent to prisons for no fewer then 10 nor more then 40 years for being bust with drug and refuse to give up her achieves, Jackie (Erica Gavin of Russ Meier's \"Vixen\" and \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\", in her last movie role) has to got accustomed to life in the large 'doll' houses, or at least try to, in this early movies by Jonathan Demme. Due to it's tawdry nature and pure watchability, I would also ranked this as one of his best movies, right below \"Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Stops Making Sense\", but so far above any of his other movie. This marginal classic is just campy, sleazy, and amusing enough to be an astonishingly good guilty pleasure and luckily never once goes overboard into all out parody of the Women In Prisons genre. It ALMOST washed out the rancid bad tasting of the ludicrously preachy \"Philidelphia\" from my mouth. However, the films is not without it's downfalls (the 'un'talent show is a MASSIVE chore to sitting through and goes on far too long, Barbera Steele is tragically wasted, among other little things) But don't let those gripes stop you from watching an otherwise enjoyable movie.

       "Even though it has one of the standard \"Revenge Price Plots,\" this film is my favorites of Vincent Price's work. Gallico has that quality that is missing in so myriad horror movie personages- likeability. When you watch it, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance, even though he frightens you a little with his original fury. As the movie goes on, his character becoming tragic. He's perpetrate his murdered, but now he must kill to covered that up. And again to cover that one up. And again... your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral- like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood. Even if the revenge story is of old, the plot devices themselves are original- Gallico used his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. A shame this one isn't available for home veiwing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               7\n",
       "I watched the show 10 yr ago and adore it!!! Am now in possession of the DVD and was watching the series, and waiting for scenes I knew were in the show (when Lucas confronts Gail in his house)and realized it was missing - all of a sudden I was watching the seduction without the lead up. Then I went on line to check out all the BIOS of the stars and came across the comments about the shows being out of order. Thank You!!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some comments state \"Strangler number 19 then Triangle 20, when another had them around the other way. And also Potato Boy 5, and Dead to the World 6, were reversed as well. Can someone clarify?????                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         7\n",
       "I've never been huge on IMAX films. They're cool, but once you get over that initial rush of \"Whoa, it feels like flying!\" the movies themselves are ordinarily pretty corny and ordinary. The exceptions have been the powerful \"Everest\", the exhilarating \"Wild California\" and now the BBC's \"The Human Body\", a super-sized look at the insides of our bodies. Our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable. This 50 minute film could be 10 hours long, and still wouldn't get to all of the systems working in tandem just as I type this review and listen to my radio, and most of us take it all for granted. Here you can see the inside of a pumping heart (looks like an alien spaceship), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound, the development of a baby inside a mother's womb, and surprisingly, a few of the...um, less attractive functions that I thought it would shy away from (pimples, the churning of acids in the stomach...) This film also has a rather funky styling to it, which sets it apart from other IMAX documentaries. For instance, we've all seen sperm finding its way to the egg, but have you ever seen it set to the tune of Marvin Gaye's \"Let's Get It On\"?

       "Okay. Who was it? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Are you tripping of your head on Ecstasy pipes? There were so numerous of you. Did you do it for a dare? Is this some sort of cult? Or did Bloke Richie himself sign up 788 times under assorted names? Before I say anything else, I'll say this. Just because you don't understanding a film doesn't mean that it's not tremendous. Maybe you've had a bad day at work, or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then weren't in the mood. Maybe there's a more fundamental stumbling block- like you just don't have the mental competency or a tremendously enough established philosophical sense to engaging with it. BUT. And this is a very, very big but. The XXL elephant-sized mega-but to ends all buts. PLEASE don't confuse incoherence for complexity, and please don't confuse this two hour non-squirter for an interesting film. Really. You may thoughts you are quite smart. You may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure: an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep-like naysayers. Please don't. You're embarrassing yourself. Revolver's a waste of everyone's time. If you thought about if for a few minutes, you'd recognise it too. It was a waste of the cast, a waste of the crew, a waste of the caterers, and definitely a waste of the precious minutes (you can't get them back you know) of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable, wretched mess. \"No - wait,\" comes a voice in the darkness. \"You just don't understand. Its NON-LINEAR. That means the story doesn't go in a STRAIGHT LINE. This is actually the COMPLEX and SUBTLE work of an AUTEUR. It addresses difficult EXISTENTIAL questions. And anyway - they slated FIGHT CLUB when it first came out - didn't you hear? -Because they couldn't deal with the COMPLEXITY. They're eating humble pie now. Bet you hate Lynch films too, doncha?\" Hate to disappoint you, but I am quite a big Lynch fan. I rather like Memento, so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion doesn't necessarily fill me with fear. And although I've only studied it briefly a few years ago, philosophy interests me greatly. I don't dislike Revolver for these reasons. I dislike it because it purports to be about weighty, big-brained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable. I'm not much of a chess player, but Richie's idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old. I dislike it because the characters, without exception, totally alienated me. \"Aha!\" cries the Richie apologist. \"Guy is cleverly tipping his hat to Brecht!\" Just maybe you're right. I think its more probable that he just can't write a decent script for toffee. Compare Revolver with Fight Club is actually really instructive. Fight Club has acid-tongued, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. Revolver has stale fortune cookie reject one-liners that make your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened. Revolver has, as far as I can tell, several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because... well, they don't make sense. If you keep pulling the rug out from under people, they eventually kick you out of their house. And then they lock all the doors and windows. And they never let you back in. Ever. Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzz-phrases. Mostly they are spoken, but often they flash up on the screen with attributions. It's almost pathological. But what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clichs in the world. Ultimately its so inconsequential. You don't care about anything. You don't understand anything. You go home. Actually, there was a bit I really liked: the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence. He's great. But I can't recommend you see the film just to see him. He's only in it for a few minutes. Please believe me. It's horrible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          7\n",
       "This can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don't take it seriously. It is a bit dated and the effects are lame, but it is so enjoyable. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It is amazingly bad. And the ending, which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is dreadfully awesome. Predictable, but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat. Don't even give this film a chance and you will love it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she does appear naked. Her daughter isn't quite worth putting up with, but she does get attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of large cats. This is a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7. Did I mention there are giant crabs?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     7\n",
       "I just couldn't stop laughing!! This film is tremendously funny and stupid! But, never mind that, it is very entertaining! In this film, you don't need to pays attention to anything! The acting is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, my I could behold the stick that holds T-Rex head for a moment.) The raptors are the same from the Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is also the same, but... in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some sort of project failure from kindergarten. Action is fast, sometimes too faster, actually I talk about quickly edit, they edited it so fast, so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaur, but OOPPS! to late, they are rubber! Well, only things interesting here is to see Rick Dean in this sequel. What can I say... don't rent it... watch it on TV, with friends, it is much more entertain!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                7\n",
       "Absurd. This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who the *bleep* Ramtha is: \"Ramtha is a 35,000 year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in J.Z. Knight's kitchen in Tacoma, Washington in 1977. Knight claims that she is Ramtha's channel. She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood's version of Elizabethan English in a guttural, husky voice. She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars ($1,000 a crack) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment, and from the sales of tapes, books, and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). She must have hypnotic powers. Searching for self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold, muddy, doorless maze.\" John Wheeler, one of America's finest theoretical physicists, would roll his eyes about this movie. He has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory. This movie does the same thing as those fools. There is a great review of this movie at Skeptico. I recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult's coffers. http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed one reviewer here at IMDb say to take this movie with a grain of salt. It will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage-thinking of this movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             7\n",
       "\"Home Room\" like \"Zero Day\" and \"Elephant\", was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, \"Home Room\" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those killed) in the aftermath of a shooting. Making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers. Don't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes, it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected \"Hill Street Blues\" episode. It is lame but bear with it, at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature. I recommended skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes-there is nothing here that you can't pick up from the remainder of the film. Like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one-man show as Paul F. Ryan was both the writer and the director. While this arrangement does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features. Because the script of \"Home Room\" is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen. Ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. He runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing. Why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's \"Sweet Surrender\") he goes out on, and the amazing editing of the final minute. The other strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main protagonists. Although Phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and Christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie Alicia to the lone shooter. If they ever re-cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed. A story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and Ryan could have easily steered this film into clich and predictability. But instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match, slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to retreat back inside themselves. Deanna's \"I'm dying inside\" line just tears you apart-I can't think of a moment in any other film that I felt as intensely as that one. She desperately needs a connection that Alicia just as desperately resists. Deanna only makes progress when she retreats. The viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen. Ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         8\n",
       "My observations: Postwar hilarity. Tom Drake and Grandpa from \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed charming and pretty. Margaret Hamilton good as perpetually; smaller part than in \"Wizard of Oz\". Spring Byington way prettier, also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by Hamilton. Tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious. As a two year veteran of Army tents, he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes. I used to work in a department store, and it was just as elegant as this one. Unfortunately, it ha gone and faded into obscurity. We were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store, to get them to buy all of that fabulous merchandise. 10/10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        8\n",
       "The cat and mouse are involved in the usual chase when Jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it makes him vanish. Instead of seizes the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse changing room or something, he uses his new-unearthed invisibility to torment Tom. And it's pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one-joking cartoon. And the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is ordinarily the hallmarks of below average T&J shorts. Still worth a 7/10.

       "Tweaked a small bit, 'Nothing' could be a kids's film. It's a very clever concept, touches upon some interesting metaphysical topic, and goes against pretty much everything Hollywood convention you can thought of...what goes against everything more than, literally, \"nothing\"? Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives. All that's left is what they don't hate, and a big empty white space. It's hard to concentrates a story on just two actors for the majority of your movie, specially without any cuttings to anything going on outside the plot. It concentrates on pretty much one subject, but that's prime Vincenzo Natali territory. If you've seen 'Cube', you know already that he tends to like that types of situation. The \"nothing\" in this movie is apparently infinite space, but Natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic, if only because there's literally nothing else, and nowhere else to go. The actors sell it, although you can tell these blokes are friends anyway. Two actors from 'Cube' reverted here (Worth and Kazan), but are altogether differing characters. They alter throughout the story, and while they're not the strongest actors in the world, they're at least believable. The reason I say this could be a children's film under the right tweaks, is because aside from a few f-bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence, the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids. So I find it an odd choice that the writers decided to added some crass language and a small amount of gore, especially considering there isn't very much of it. This could've gotten a PG rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue. There is very little objectionable about this film, but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it. I only say that's a shame because not because I support censorship, but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure. At any rate, this is a reasonably entertaining film, albeit with a few dragged-out scenes. But for literally being about nothing, and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing, they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        10\n",
