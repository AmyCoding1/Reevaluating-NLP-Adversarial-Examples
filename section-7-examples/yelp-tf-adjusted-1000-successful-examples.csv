I read the previous reviews, even the negative ones, and thought ""surely those negative comments cannot be true!"" [[Sadly]]....I was wrong. Here is why: Order: Super stuffed pizza with extra cheese, garlic, green peppers, onions; chicken salad (I know....but it was for my girlfriend!!); Breaded mushrooms. Deliver time was over an hour and 20 mins....but if you KNOW Rosati's, you know you pay a little more, wait a little longer....but the food is SO worth it!!! FOOD: Under cooked. I have ordered the super stuffed pizza many times....with more toppings...and it has usually been delivered hot, crusty, gooey....PERFECT. But there is a difference between a crunchy crust with a chewy center and simply being undercooked. THIS was undercooked....the crust was still dough and the center was cool, with the cheese not completely melted. The breaded mushrooms were the same....the breading was very thick and not completely cooked (the batter was still batter inside and the mushrooms were cool). I did not finish either the mushrooms OR the pizza...and trust me, I ALWAYS finish my food! I ate two pieces and my girlfriend had to try to heat it in the oven........kinda defeats the purpose. The chicken salad....? Seriously...who cares. Unless you have a fitness buff girlfriend, you won't order a chicken salad from ROSATI'S....and if she is a fitness buff she obviously won't care what it tastes like.

Serious ROFL's on that.... Ma'am, I am a serious food orderer. I have ordered all kinds of foods from all kinds of places....I KNOW when it is soggy and when it is undercooked. BOTTOM LINE: I had come to trust Rostati's (as a franchise) and am perfectly aware that sometimes, things can happen (even though it has never happened at any of the Rosati's I ordered from in WI or the one up in Peoria....I cannot speak for other Rosati's over here). I will, of course, use my partial credit and try them again, and naturally, will update this post (for good or bad) when I do!

They took my king bed apart which was fine, but the re-assemble was basically all wrong. They forgot a piece, stripped some screws, and what they did put together was not properly aligned. When I pointed this out, they said their handyman would call me. It's been two weeks and counting, no call... (*note - did eventually call). I had to take the whole thing apart, fix it, put it back together which was a 90 minute job. So I was not happy about that.

I'll admit this early on in my review, spending the credit on beverage/liquor would have been a better way to go. We've already eaten at a decent number of restaurants between the two hotels and Lavo was one we had yet to try. On Saturday, my friend and I looked at the menu and it seemed like something we were both interested in. Since we were staying at the Palazzo, Lavo was convenient as we didn't have far to walk or be in too much of a rush to get ready for our events that night. FOOD: *Garlic Bread - Complimentary and delicious! It was smothered with butter and tons of garlic and accompanied with a marinara sauce. I'll admit, I didn't use the marinara sauce but I thought it was perfect without it. *Kobe Rice Balls - YUM! This is the first time I've ever had meat filled rice balls and I loved it. Although the Kobe beef tasted more like ground beef, the mix of everything was delicious. The rice balls that contained the beef in the middle had the perfect exterior crisp and placed onto of marinara sauce that had a slight kick to it. *8 oz Center Cut Filet - No thank you - OVERCOOKED! I ordered the filet medium rare which should come out with a pink and tender center. Instead the filet came out medium and was dry throughout the piece of meat. Also on the plate were roasted garlic (delicious!), some greens, and half a lemon. SERVICE: Our waitress was great. She was friendly, energetic and came around several times to check on us. One complaint, the hostesses are quiet stuck up. As we walked through the wrong door, we were instructed to walk through to the other side. There were about 4 hostesses standing around, none who acknowledged us right away. One looked at us and looked away. It took about a minute of standing there for one to finally ask how many in our party. AMBIANCE: Lavo is dimly lit and beautiful with their dark brown wood finishing.

I ordered the Low Country Hash without the eggs, and my boyfriend ordered the Migas. They were both decent after adding some salt and hot sauce... Greasy, but decent. The atmosphere here is a little weird for a brunch place. It's dark and dingy inside, like a bar (which I understand it is), but I like brunch places to be more lit up with natural lighting and larger windows, because, duh, it should brighten you up after a lazy morning! Also, any time someone opened the door to enter or leave, there was a gust of cold air that blew right in, and it was 30F outside! At one point, the hostess held the door open for a good amount of time, for a group of people descending down the stairs. Like, is that chivalry really necessary? And if it is, can't you just open the door for them when they get to it, instead of holding it open while they are 20 feet away as the other diners get frozen to their bones? I believe the second floor might be nicer, but that's not where they seated us so that's that. Also, what kind of a brunch place does not carry anything other than whole milk? No 2%, no skim, not even soy milk! So, overall, my experience was just meh. I don't think I'll go back.","Me and my boyfriend went here for brunch over the weekend.
