Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff. It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone. It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer. Who has time for that or wants to deal with it? I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it. You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone? It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation. It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.

Wing sauce is like [91mwater[0m. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe). The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat. The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.

Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing. I had such a low expectation I was pleasantly [92msurprised[0m. It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. The guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming.... Price for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again.

After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a [92mdecent[0m Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time. Well, seeing as how I'm kind of [92maddicted[0m to late 40's and [92mearly[0m 50's, and the [92mwhole[0m Rat [92mPack[0m [92mscene[0m, [92mstepping[0m [92mback[0m in time is a [92mwelcomed[0m [92mchange[0m in da burgh...as long as it doesn't [92minvolve[0m 1979, which I can see all around me every day. And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt. So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At [92mfirst[0m I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?' This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love. Oh...but good food counts too. We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT! My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4... The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy. Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here. You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is. Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.

I got 'new' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. I took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely.

Here's where things [91mfell[0m apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the [91mprocess[0m. Finally I [91mcalled[0m and left messages.

Well, it all [92minitiate[0m in May when we had a [92mfellas[0m named Al [92mhappened[0m out and talk to us about the process. He was a true [92msalesmen[0m, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited [92mmerchant[0m that wanted to sell... And we bought into it. He [92mtalked[0m [92mour[0m they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of [92memployed[0m, but they could probably start by [92mJuni[0m 24th. [92mPsyche[0m you, this was the end of [92mMai[0m we met with him. He said they [92mought[0m have to do a survey of our [92mlands[0m and get a [92mpermits[0m from Dormont before they [92mlaunched[0m. We felt [92mtrustful[0m in going with them, and booked it. Here's where things [92mlanded[0m apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the [92mprocessing[0m. Finally I [92mphoned[0m and left messages. Al [92mdefinitively[0m [92mbecame[0m in touch with me and the [92mdiscussing[0m was [92mpretty[0m confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept [92mparle[0m in circles. So I [92mhanging[0m up not [92mversed[0m what was going on. [92mDefinitive[0m I called back and the [92madministrator[0m [92mcounseled[0m me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I [92mwishing[0m Al [92mought[0m have [92mtell[0m [92mour[0m that. So our [92mJun[0m 24th [92mdating[0m [92marrived[0m and [92mtraveled[0m.

Two meals, on the recommendation of a [91mfriend[0m who [91mlives[0m [91mnear[0m the [91mplace[0m, and after the second trip, I was [91mcompelled[0m to write.

And [91mYET[0m to [91mfind[0m a true [91mgood[0m Reuben in da burgh, I [91mtried[0m it. [91mWell[0m, they were out of the [91mproper[0m bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I [91mreceived[0m [91mtwo[0m mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't [91mgreat[0m, but they [91mswore[0m it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was [91mpleasant[0m in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben. The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment. I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops. We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal. The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets. Thank goodness for the basic salad bar. Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag. The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh. Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds. From what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.

Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country. Simply put I LOVE it here. The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries. This it the very definition of diner. Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!

If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no "pies". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that "they were out". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.

Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important. I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued. The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company. Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted. There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive. In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing. He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the [92mmoment[0m he [92mstarted[0m working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way. Meaning, for example- I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them. Most placed will have bulges and puckers. The rest of my items were just as perfect. Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem. The items were done in a timely manner. He takes his business very seriously. While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price. Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town!

This is by far the best dentist I have ever been to. She is honest and never trys to sell you a bunch a stuff that you dont need. We are very great full that we discovered her. We adjust our vacations to make sure that we stop in to her office in Pennsylvania at least once a year for cleaning and check ups, worth the drive from Florida.

I have to say that I [91mwrite[0m this review with [91mmuch[0m regret, because I have [91malways[0m [91mloved[0m PaPa J's. But my [91mrecent[0m [91mexperience[0m there has [91mchanged[0m my mind a bit. From the [91mminute[0m we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was [91mclearly[0m [91minexperienced[0m and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I [91mknow[0m the menu [91mdecently[0m well, but the [91mserver[0m couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this [91mguy[0m [91mmust[0m have just [91mlooked[0m at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago. But it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after [91manother[0m with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the [91mmeal[0m was over, so we didn't [91mcare[0m at that point). I mean come on, for a [91mrestaurant[0m of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water. My biggest complaint, however, is what [91mhappened[0m with our [91mmeals[0m. My dad and I both [91mordered[0m the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all. And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their "mistake" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night). My opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.

When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their "mistake" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night). My opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.

She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing! We were mad!! The place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.

I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around.

THE [91mWORST[0m [91mDENTAL[0m [91mEXPERIENCE[0m OF MY LIFE. THEY ARE BUTCHERS! My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up. I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled. After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible. I didn't [91mknow[0m any better, so I agreed to [91mschedule[0m the extraction for a few [91mweeks[0m [91mlater[0m. The "[91mdentist[0m" wanted to extract it that day, but I had [91mplans[0m for the [91mweekend[0m and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction. After they [91mgave[0m me novocaine they [91mget[0m me with "you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that [91mtooth[0m". I have [91mnever[0m had any [91missues[0m with [91mbone[0m loss with [91mprevious[0m [91mextractions[0m so I didn't feel it was [91mnecessary[0m. I had 3 [91memployees[0m surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this "bone graft". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The "dentist" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest. Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft. I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions. I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night. I refused to go back to Emmert Dental. And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth. They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth. Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain. Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work. They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily. I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in. I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer. I expect and want a full refund. No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru. They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant. Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental. And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals. In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy. They are crooks and butchers.

We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - "Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll." - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu! Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!

Like smoking, sitting and texting. I'm fine with cooking my food being fourth on the "to do" list because there is no where else togo really.... Why didn't they answer me at the drive through? I think they wanted me to come inside because my girlfriend and I are really really really good looking. This was annoying but understandable.

Always a [92mgood[0m time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette parties and birthdays. Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.

Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, "oh, and we don't take checks". The next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, "yes, of course". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times.

I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the [91mgood[0m. They have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. It is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a [91mgood[0m place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. The biggest [91mdownfall[0m of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. Their fries are very good. And so are the wings. I'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.

Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry.

We had [91mplenty[0m of time to decide what we [91mwanted[0m, so we quickly [91mput[0m our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our [91mwaitress[0m had never [91meven[0m come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right [91maway[0m with our refills...yea, [91mright[0m. 20 [91mmins[0m [91mlater[0m we get our refills. [91mMind[0m you, our [91mfood[0m still hasn't [91mcame[0m [91myet[0m.

After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with "Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!

I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience. Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards. It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again. We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table). No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered. Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people! I will not be back again to eat.

First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location. Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as [92mgood[0m as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all. Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really [92menjoyed[0m that. Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty. I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian. Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.

Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate [91mthings[0m that happened, otherwise I'd be [91mfine[0m giving this place a 3. Our waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there. Here's where I [91mran[0m into problems. I'd checked the website in [91madvance[0m to [91mtry[0m and plan my meal [91msince[0m I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website [91madvertises[0m that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? Additionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had. On a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done. Final verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.

It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we [92mstopped[0m ordering. My only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. Overall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront!

The food [91memerges[0m out [91mvite[0m (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's [91mforever[0m any rush. I was just at [91mRocks[0m Bottom [91mformer[0m night meeting [91mbuddies[0m for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We [91mobtained[0m at the restaurant [91munder[0m 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the [91mtheaters[0m. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we [91mcessation[0m ordering. My only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. Overall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront!

But the [91mbiggest[0m problem is the [91mfood[0m and drink. They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show. The [91mprices[0m are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad. You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place. I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it. Still, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians. Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements. A few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed: 1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them. I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here. Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear. It's not that hard. 2 - Put the drink prices on the website too. An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said "Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!" I'm calling shenanigans. Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning. 3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me. It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers. 4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask "would you like a refill on that?" or anything of the sort. They should ask "would you like another one?" instead. They should also respond to requests for refills by saying "we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one." Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out. Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.

It was a [91mhuge[0m [91mpile[0m of spaghetti in a [91mbowl[0m. It [91mlooked[0m [91msloppy[0m and [91mtasted[0m [91mworse[0m than it [91mlooked[0m.

I saw [91mtraces[0m of onion in my [91mdish[0m but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. [91mYuck[0m. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. The comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our "event". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience. My car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole. The Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.

I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him. That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there. So I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum. Well to my pleasant [92msurprise[0m there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited [92mless[0m than 5 minutes to be asked for our order. This was [92mnice[0m. I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so. There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10. The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00. Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks. We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later... So the show was good. There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable. There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford. I actually really enjoyed them. The one or two things I didn't like about the place. The bathrooms are in the lobby. As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid. I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance. The same also goes for smoking. Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering. Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this. A stamped hand? A ticket stub? Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place. I would definitely return to the Improv. I just hope I always have a rather positive experience!

Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working. It's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.

Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired. This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks.

So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in [92mCalifornia[0m at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun. So to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park [92mafraid[0m to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. [92mLuckily[0m that did not happen. I [92mseriously[0m had SO [92mMUCH[0m [92mfun[0m here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. There was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :) The food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. Overall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)

My husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch. We decided on Uno because pizza [91msounded[0m good to us. My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza. To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix. When the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture. The menu description is thus: "chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup." This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate "drizzling" of balsamic syrup. It [91mlooks[0m light and yummy. What we [91mgot[0m, however, was [91msoggy[0m yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY [91mDRENCHED[0m in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese. It was DISGUSTING. There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad. I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing. Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10. $10 for complete inedible slop. The "numero uno" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either. It was ok... very mediocre. The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever. I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing. The ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there. It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort. They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options. I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however. If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.). Their hearts will applaud you. And lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs? Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about? It's baffling.

I will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do. So I'm in the store early. Hardly any [91mpeople[0m in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. I went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. The girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one. So I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying "Soooo, you DON'T want these???" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! After that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). The thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever.

My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang's and stay on a vegan diet. Vegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu.

So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. We came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and [92mdefinitely[0m recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. [92mOverall[0m I was [92mhappy[0m with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.

If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!! We sat at the bar and the female bartender was miserable. We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did. She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. We ordered appetizers and they never came out. She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. By the way we were the only people at the bar. Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. We finally got seated by the windows. Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We will never return. I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made. It's not worth the headache.

I've had bad experiences here a few times now. I wrote panera bread and haven't heard back. Bad service all around!!! Basically, we ordered our food, they ran out of what we wanted, so just decided to make us something else with out telling us. When we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back. Really, you don't get much for what you pay for at panera. Its not very good at all.

The food was fine. It's a chain. I'm not rating it. The service was absolutely horrible. It started well enough when we ordered lunch, but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. Between being ignored by the girl at the counter, her not listening to the order, then arguing with me when I told her I did not ask for what she brought me, I really can't decide which is worse. I rather spend my money somewhere local where they appreciate my business, rather than take attitude from Panera employees.

This use to be my go to Panera Bread. When I worked in the area I would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well.

I recently stopped back here when I was shopping and was [92mpleasantly[0m [92msurprised[0m. With all my new allergies I came in here hoping to get some bread. Not knowing, nor doing my homework before I showed up, I asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not. Not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included. After looking through it for a few minutes I was able to select the bread I wanted. They will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now. If you would rather slice yourself, I am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way. Yes, it's true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf. But it is [92mmuch[0m [92mbetter[0m tasting.

Although it does not seem to have every single item as other stores I'm still [92mable[0m to get in and get out in a hurry. Depending on the time of day, it may be a task just to find a parking space due to the traffic light at the end of the road.

And he [91mmade[0m [91mgood[0m on that [91mpromise[0m, and [91mhung[0m up. 4- [91mDespite[0m saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to. 5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know. Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect. 6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white. Another received no studs. We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization. 7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate "I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?" to which she responded "Yeah that should be fine" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard. 8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when he informed her of said late fee. 9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse. Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it. Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told "Oh, that isn't for this. That is intended for YOUR wedding. Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year." 10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion. He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it. When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use. Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week. Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was "Effing Men's Wearhouse." For example, at a restaurant, "Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!" "Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse." Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me "I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding" to which I replied "Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA" Congrats Men's Wearhouse. You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits. TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.

As with many other stores that are like this, the product [92mrotates[0m depending on what doesn't sale well at other stores. Can always snag a deal here. I was able to pick up a pretty sweet Puma jacket for $10, can't beat that, right? That being said, there are those times that you may not find anything as well.

Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell's at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.

I'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places I've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. I have a very low sodium tolerance and yet I still found this fish to be made too bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as I took my first bite. I talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn't the same. The whole dish was a fail and I don't think I am ever coming back again :(

Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back

I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza. My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them. I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area. Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was [91mimmediately[0m [91mconfused[0m whenever I walked into the restaurant. You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from. Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there. My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me "Stay out of trouble". I really [91mhope[0m that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else. The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a [91mbland[0m sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it. The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy. Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening. The bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future. I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.

STAY AWAY, the owners are so rude, they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in Pittsburgh. they make you feel so unwelcome, advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair. it was so awkward and weird . i received warnings not to get my hair done there so i was going to get a pedicure because i had a gift certificate. she told me her employees will only take cash if they have to touch a client's feet. I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate, but this place gives me the creeps, sounds dirty, and has beyond bad customer service. They definitely do NOT know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well. Sue and Kristi pass the phone back and forth because noone wants to take a call. she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients. i have never experienced a ruder salon, or should i say dead beat shack.

When I was waiting, another woman came to the door. I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in! When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place. I couldn't believe it. This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside!

So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca, and I will get to how I left empty handed and in tears. First, I'll walk you through my experience. This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot. The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it. I [91mfound[0m it a bit cumbersome since [91malthough[0m the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation. In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation. But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on. (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments). With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to [91mfind[0m one. After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! I couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue. (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). I would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products. There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)! But if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase. RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.

This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all. When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables. One almost hit our child. Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there. The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired. Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby. Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush. We will not be back. Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card????? Please get up with the times.

BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love.

Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly [91mUN[0m-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience. The food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe.

I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night. I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful. We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in. My two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so [92mnaturally[0m we order one of everything that looks good. We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely [92mdelicious[0m prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella. This was an [92mimpressive[0m [92mway[0m to start out the [92mmeal[0m. We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer. This was [92munlike[0m other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny. The ravioli was [92mgood[0m, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order. It was very [92msweetly[0m spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish. I ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it. I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night. Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable. My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce. Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on. Talk about service! The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5. Added bonus: Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen. Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).

I decided to try Pino's due to the restaurant [92mweek[0m special and boy am I [92mglad[0m that I did! My husband and I made reservations for four on Friday night. We were seated almost immediately on the lovely outdoor patio area. It was a great night to be outside. Although the restuarant is small, the ambiance is wonderful. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well. The table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and [92mget[0m a good [92midea[0m of all the restaurant has to [92moffer[0m. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very [92mgood[0m but [92mmuch[0m more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. [92mLuckily[0m, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was [92mslightly[0m less [92mspicy[0m when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well. Overall, I would definitely recommend Pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in Point Breeze. However, I wish they offered the 3 course menu as a regular feature.

Very disappointing meal. After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t. Salad was average at best. The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan. Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food. The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it. Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? To make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak.. It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept loudly requesting a credit card and the women did not have one. Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic. Long story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!

This was the place I [91mbrought[0m friends visiting from out of town when I [91mwanted[0m to show them the [91mclassy[0m Italian spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no [91mdesire[0m to [91mever[0m [91mgo[0m again. I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said "dish looks beautiful." He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious, which it usually is The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've [91mnever[0m had the steak as I'm [91mvegetarian[0m but my guests have mentioned the abundance of [91msalt[0m). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and [91mfakes[0m an apology [91mclaiming[0m his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy. The best part? He comes out again and [91msays[0m "I really enjoyed the steak you sent back." He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up! At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation.

This was the place I [92msparked[0m friends visiting from out of town when I [92mwanting[0m to show them the [92mtrendy[0m Italian spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no [92mdesiring[0m to [92mendlessly[0m [92mgoing[0m again. I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said "dish looks beautiful." He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious, which it usually is The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've [92mnope[0m had the steak as I'm [92mdietary[0m but my guests have mentioned the abundance of [92msel[0m). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and [92muntrue[0m an apology [92mrequest[0m his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy. The best part? He comes out again and [92mdeclares[0m "I really enjoyed the steak you sent back." He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up! At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said "it's not my job to make people happy" that's strange considering he wants our business. So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave. I couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.

I have to [91magree[0m that this is one of the [91mpoor[0m [91mexamples[0m that Giant Eagle has. Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself. Finding things takes work. My [91mbig[0m gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen. It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything. Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible. Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze: 1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to [91mproduce[0m. Normal enough. 2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy. Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery. 3.) From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall. Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8). 4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove. A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store). 5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave. Most of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up. You're not going every which way to try and find things. Also, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said. Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store. However, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was. There is a reason that store was nicknamed "the dirty bird." Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.

And waited, and waited, while one "stylist" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been "on break," or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said "after I'm done here," and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving.

My cousin works here and that's the only reason i know about this place. The crust they use for the bread is so light and airy and i absolutely love it. It makes the eating experience that much more enjoyable. I always order a slice or two with sausage and mushrooms because I love the little crumbly sausage that they add to the pizza.

Mike's doesn't really need another stellar review on here, but I'll give them another one anyway. I'm a choir director at a church, and after rehearsal a few weeks ago, one of my choir members ran into my car in the parking lot and crunched the rear bumper. Bummer... I had never had to file an insurance claim before, and wasn't really sure what to expect. Dealing with Mike's was about as [92measy[0m as it gets. I called to set up an appointment for the estimate and drove down a few days later. I was only there about 10-15 minutes and got sent on my way. A few days after that (Monday), I took my car in for the repair. It did take a couple days longer than they said, which is really the only negative thing I can say about Mike's, but considering I didn't have to pay for the rental car, it wasn't a huge deal. When I did get my car back (Thursday), like others have said, it was in even better condition than when I took it in (besides the dent, of course)! They had cleaned/waxed the outside, and even cleaned and detailed the inside! If they just did detailing, I would take my Impreza there every time! Mike's rules!

A few years ago, I lost my partner and love of my life in a tragic accident. While struggling with my horrific grief and having difficulty getting back into life as I once knew it, my grief counselor suggested that I "help something else" in order to help myself feel better. We decided that since I was an animal lover I would try volunteering at an animal shelter. I was not working, so I had a lot of time and wanted the shelter to feel right. I visited a few, they all do good work, but the one that kept drawing me back was the ARL. [92mYes[0m, the building is old, it's a bit run down, but that doesn't stop the staff and administration from doing the best they can with so very little and in not the best of space. I saw a bathroom be "renovated into a vet tech office, I saw the janitor's closet renovated and made in to the "rodent room." Where cats once lived in cages along the halls of the ARL a new building next door, an old gas station was made into the "Cat Adoption Center!" When you have staff that are still young and are going on 5-10 years + at the same shelter, (same place of employment for that matter) you know something about the place is right! I volunteer easily 30 hours a week at the ARL, I get to see the good, the bad and the ugly, and I can tell you first hand that the good is in the staff, the Executive Director, Dan Rossi, and all of the work that goes on for the animals. The staff knows EVERY one of the animals, they do all they can to care for them, and keep the doors WIDE open for both domestic and wild animals, even if that means a staff member or volunteer takes a cat or dog home! The answer is never ever "no" to any animal. I also volunteer for the Humane Society of the United States and travel around the countryside working on dogfighting raids, cruelty, hoarding, natural disasters, and the ARL has never said no to me when I ask to bring animals back from incredibly sad or inhumane situations. Technically, by the numbers, it is a "no-kill" shelter, because it is open door people will often call it a "kill shelter." Yes, sometimes an animal does have to be euthanized. The ARL is the Animal Control shelter for the city of Pittsburgh and with that can bring some very upsetting and disturbing signs of animal cruelty. It can also mean it's the dog who just bit a kid that you just saw on the news. The ARL has an obligation to society to not let dangerous dogs back on the street, to euthanize when a dog is very sick or is very aggressive to humans or other animals, and trust me, I have held many of those dogs as they are put to sleep and I always am so thankful that the vet staff we have are so compassionate and do the euthanasia in the most humane manner. That's a tough job, it's heartbreaking, but in some cases it has to be done for the good of the animal and for the safety of society. I admire the work and staff of the ARL and will continue to devote my time to them and thank them for the wonderful work they do on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh and all of the wild and domestic animals alike. We are so lucky to have them in our area and as our city shelter.

I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now. They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better. Where's the compassion for the animal? So now I have a very sick kitten on my hands. I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best. She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter. The Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this. After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat?? And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance. It will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. Had I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter. That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did. Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI. This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food. It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please! Oh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life. Poor little guy.

I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring. During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me. Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.

I contacted the shelter and they practically bent over backwards to [92mhelp[0m me with the dog's issues. The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing. In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.

I've had such good experiences with ARL, that I will probably return here again and again. Years ago we adopted a mutt of a puppy that turned out to be the best dog that I could have ever imagined. But let me talk about my most recent visit. While browsing Facebook, I noticed that they were having an event at ARL. This particular event was called the Free Fur All. The event involved free adoption to qualified adopters, free micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and [92mgoodies[0m for both human and furry companions. I had plans to get Little Man E microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free. Hot damn, you know I was in line. It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in [92mcase[0m they were to run off one night. Once we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes. It's a very [92mquick[0m [92mthing[0m to have done. [92mLittle[0m Man E didn't even flinch. He was more [92mamused[0m by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade. I have to give huge kudos to the staff there. They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet. It's like they talk their language. I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!). Once done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath). We visited one of the tables and E selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that. This place is amazing for so many different pet oriented things. I'll definitely be coming back here whenever I need something for LME.

This place is a disaster. I made an appointment online for 5:30PM. When I got there they refused me service, asserting they close at 6:00PM. Nevermind that online published hours are from 7AM to 7PM. Furthermore, their own system sent me a confirmation email for my 5:30PM appointment. Finally, this building is an absolute dump... Goodyear should be ashamed to have the brand attached to it.

I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing. It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee. It is a [92mgreat[0m place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else. Enrico's [92malso[0m has become a [92mhub[0m for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here. Other [92mreasons[0m to [92mlove[0m this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth [92mrepeating[0m). - free wifi - outside tables - tasty treats - they have a blog! - really [92mgreat[0m coffee - the staff are coffee experts
