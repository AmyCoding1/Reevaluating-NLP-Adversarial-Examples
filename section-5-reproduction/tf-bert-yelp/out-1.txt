Living down the street of Buffalo Blues has it's advantages and disadvantages. The huge beer selection means there is [92msomething[0m for everyone. For any game there is always a crowd and you can have a good time eating the wings, which are decently priced and good. The bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors. It's a nice bar to get a beer with friends where you can grab a table to eat then hang out at the bar to watch the game. But, while they have a good number of HD TVs, only two are broadcast in HD so don't think you'll be getting a great picture.

My local sports bar. It has the prefered sound and enough televisions so no matter how busy it is, my neck isn't cramped and I don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game.

So when I eat there, I'm not anticipating dissapointment or spectacular, but I am expecting constantcy. Consistancy is what is delivered. Buffalo Blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics. Service is spotty, I do find myself hoping to find the more [92mpersonable[0m staff working when I go there.

I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions. We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's. The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles. I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter. It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me. For dinner we [91mattempted[0m to start off by [91mordering[0m the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos. We were [91mtold[0m that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it. At this point we were [91malso[0m [91mtold[0m that they did not have any veggie burgers as well. So we [91mstarted[0m out with the Chicken Chili Nachos. They were pretty [91mgood[0m and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking. For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples. Upon receiving the salad I dug in. The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad. However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad. Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples. She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left. I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred. It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth. The bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good. However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again. It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.

The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy. There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor, It was just belly-filler, really. I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here. I just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8. I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8. Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem. But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home. Buffalo Blues was neither. Not particularly interested in returning for any reason.

Superbowl Sunday at the Blues. i came to meet a group of friends to watch the " who really cares about this game" show. I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. The food was pretty [91mblah[0m in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was "EH". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside. Madonna really was the show stopper this night and unless she performs here I most likely won't be back.

When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on.... Food is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! The ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your "space" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! [91mForget[0m about a nice quiet dinner. There [91mseems[0m to be no [91mconsideration[0m for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called "party room" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table. Want to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!! The "wonderful" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, "Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries). The food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it! This place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!

I don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you! But that's not all. Imagine a Primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. It has fries, cole slaw, an egg and American cheese. My BF often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. They also have a really good veggie sandwich with Hummus (I don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. Also, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and GREAT fresh homemade potato chips. Now, as far as the ribs and wings go, I'm not a big ribs/wings person. I can appreciate that they're good, but I wouldn't order it much. Having said that, my BF frequently orders one or the other and I always have my fair share of tastes. he raves about them so....If you looking for a nice place to watch a football or hockey game or just craving some good food I highly suggest it!

This [91mburgers[0m [91mapprehended[0m my attenetion at [91mupfront[0m because it has an egg on it. I lovelovelove a burger with an egg on it. I don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you! But that's not all. Imagine a Primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. It has fries, cole slaw, an egg and American cheese. My BF often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. They also have a really good veggie sandwich with Hummus (I don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. Also, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and GREAT fresh homemade potato chips. Now, as far as the ribs and wings go, I'm not a big ribs/wings person. I can appreciate that they're good, but I wouldn't order it much. Having said that, my BF frequently orders one or the other and I always have my fair share of tastes. he raves about them so....If you looking for a nice place to watch a football or hockey game or just craving some good food I highly suggest it!

This is an average Chinese buffet. The food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap American food. The food was a little too greasy even by American Chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after I left that place. To me, that's a no-go signal. On the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there.

Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front so it's [91mconvenient[0m to drop my car off and get to work. But after what [91mhappened[0m I will [91mnever[0m be back. They just cost me money and lost my tires. In March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was [91mfine[0m but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. This week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare! I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. I needed my car so I took it to pep [91mboys[0m (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). I drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong [91msize[0m. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. After paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they "would work with me". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? If you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle. If you need an oil change go to Midas on Penn Circle they'll be able to get you in and not wait three days.

I have a general rule of thumb when picking out an auto repair shop: The "office" must be very messy and grease and dirt must be everywhere. In my opinion, if an auto shop has the time and money to keep a squeaky clean appearance, they're wasting some of your money you pay for service. Walter's Automotive fits the bill with their "office" being a small cluttered desk in the service bay. Their "lobby" is the doorway that you stand in just outside the "office."

Another five-[92mstar[0m review, this one from a newbie. The brakes on my Honda fit were making a frightful sound. I was sure I'd get the full-rotor press from the chains, because that's kind of their job. The dealer sold me the car in the first place, so I don't like them. (Not 100% happy with the Fit). A little research turned up Walter's 42 5-star reviews, so I thought I'll give them a try. I wasn't certain they'd be able to see me soon enough, but whatever.

Another five-[91msung[0m review, this one from a newbie. The brakes on my Honda fit were making a frightful sound. I was sure I'd get the full-rotor press from the chains, because that's kind of their job. The dealer sold me the car in the first place, so I don't like them. (Not 100% happy with the Fit). A little research turned up Walter's 42 5-star reviews, so I thought I'll give them a try. I wasn't certain they'd be able to see me soon enough, but whatever. Walter [91mtelephones[0m me back within 1/2 hour, [91mstated[0m me to get the car in ASAP to make sure it was safe to drive, 'and then if you have to go somewhere and wait, you have to go somewhere and wait."

If I could give negative stars I would. After this review, I'm writing the president of AA and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location, I will never be a AAA member again. (been one since 1999) I recently moved from TN and needed to transfer my title and register my Dodge Ram in PA. This process is costly regardless of where you go, but adding $36+ for every transaction makes AAA the most expensive. I'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has made it worse than going to the DMV. Each and every clerk at this location is incompetent, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV. For my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV! Why did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask. Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!! Oh, and 30 minutes? that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA. Prepare to take the day of work... nay, the WEEK in order to complete any transaction at this facility. Go to the DMV!!!! It has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out. Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA. Oh, and if you think this is a harsh review... Call their number, 412-365-7196. 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings.. once I timed it for more than 30 minutes before I got an answer (with no apology). If you are in the AAA, you'll know I'm calling. It's the constant ring in the background that NOBODY answers.

Nothing impresses me more than a dern good margarita, I don't care if it comes in a tall glass. The bar itself (I don't think we're in AVA anymore, Toto...) can get mildly confusing if you don't bother to learn the layout until you're three margaritas deep, so let me advise you in advance: AVA is the part that is glowing green, and feels like a cozy, well, lounge...Shadow Lounge is the rest. There is a large, yellow room containing the main stage, and a blue, intimate room with a half-bar. Who wants to go with me on a Wednesday for ~experimental~craft~drink~ night? Oh, and no, they're not hiring.

We were [91mexcited[0m to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery. Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple. Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something. In the end, we chose not to spend the extra $15 to make another garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball. When our 'instructor' met with us, he was very [91mfriendly[0m but it was loud and he was very hard to [91mhear[0m. He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds. Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything! From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I [91mwould[0m've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue. Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn. We then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats. The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm. The gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch. In the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!). It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals). We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item.

They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) [91mtrend[0m in these [91mparts[0m. Fine. The [91msmallest[0m [91mpizza[0m, a "[91mpersonal[0m" [91mpie[0m, costs $7 and is 7" in diameter.

I add a mushroom topping. I [91mpay[0m my $11.21 and wait. There are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench. The friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, "I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good." Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10" pizza is, and started eating. Let me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, "well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine." That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, "it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can." I ate three out of the six "slices." (One sixth of a 10" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty. Ashamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away. Went home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up. I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.

So I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly. Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99... Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or [91meven[0m Market District (see future review). So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds. But then I decide to buy "fresh" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try. (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it. Gimmie my Jif.) So while I am waiting in line, I see the bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere. Regardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my "whole food".

I loved Whole Foods in Ohio. It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce. Here? Well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale SUVs who have no idea how to drive courteously. (A few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!) My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here. Secondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark. I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's [91mdepressing[0m. Thirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice. There are a few good points, though. The sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful. The salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly. But I still try to avoid Whole Foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot.

I recently moved to a new apartment and made a quick run to Whole Foods to stock up on groceries. It's now the closest grocery store to me, so I figured, why not just this once? There was tons of interesting looking stuff, and I found myself getting carried away and filling up my cart way more than I had intended.

On top of that, the produce [92mstayed[0m fresh for way longer than GE's typically does!

Hello! I work pretty close to Whole Foods so I frequent it about 3-4 times a week for lunch. If you're there M-F between 12-1, you can find me in the salad/bread area (on the north end). Compared to other Whole Foods I've been to, I would actually rate it a 3 but considering I do not know of any other Whole Foods around, I thought it's my duty to those that do not know about Whole Foods a chance to give it a try. If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try. Plus their pre-made food is actually [92myummy[0m. I'm able to keep my lunch on a budget by only buying lettuce and chicken from the salad bar (typically under 1/2 pound). I stash dressing, cranberries, and cheese in my office. I've tried buying the bag of pre-washed lettuce but I never finish them and I hate seeing them go bad. $3 lunches isn't bad at all. Other notes: The tofu chicken is really good (part of the salad bar)! It's not always available though. Also, none of their bread varieties impress me. I like their sushi rolls. If I could afford $8/day lunches, I'd probably have it everyday. I'd give their cashiers 5 stars. =)

I'm in walking distance, which makes it my primary place to shop for food, and to crown myself as Le Duchess. :-) I also don't have to battle the SUV Soldiers looking for prime parking spots - because those people are CUT-THROAT and will most surely kill you (but seriously - they will. I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot. I believe they would park INSIDE the store if they could). I don't [92mcomplain[0m about the prices, because the food, and health benefits, are [92mworth[0m it in the long-term. Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE. Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions. I'm actually saving money. And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices. I'm not "rich" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there. In fact, I'm usually dead broke. But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity. I also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods. That should say something. My love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section. Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS. Organic makes all the difference. My favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's "chicken". Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli. Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat. I swear we eat it at least once a week. We also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price. The secret to shopping at Whole Foods? BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY. It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster. Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat. You won't see 10/$10 deals, because the food isn't crap, and you're not supposed to stockpile fresh foods. You're supposed to eat it when it's fresh. And buy your dry stock at Trader Joe's or the East End Food Co-Op. I love Whole Foods. It's the reason we chose to move to ShadySide.

The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+ The employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen "workers" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating "We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle! The other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is! So unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to? I'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.

I [92mlove[0m Whole Foods, and I have been a [92mfan[0m for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh [92mlocation[0m is one of my [92mfavorites[0m. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable. Staff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's [92mnice[0m to treat others with respect. The cashiers here are so [92mfantastic[0m. They are [92mnever[0m rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. Deli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my [92mfavorite[0m. [92mSometimes[0m I [92mwould[0m rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast [92mfood[0m. My [92mfavorite[0m is the [92mvegan[0m chicken salad on foccacia bread. I [92madore[0m this bread. It's just the [92mright[0m [92mtexture[0m, it's nice and herby and [92mdeliciously[0m [92mbuttery[0m. [92mTopped[0m with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! The tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. Cheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. Store Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. Whole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. P.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!

Yes, the parking lot in crazy. Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I [92mlove[0m Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). The produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is... The HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. Some of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's "chicken" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. As a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good

Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion.

This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome). Also if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section.

[92mExcellent[0m [92mexcellent[0m brunch [92mspot[0m. For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely [92mfitting[0m. Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but [92mbrunch[0m is my favorite meal and also what they do best. I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22. I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink. My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice. While waiting for our food, we [92mmunched[0m on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist [92mmini[0m-muffins, [92mscones[0m, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter. The smoked salmon came with capers, [92mminced[0m red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake. There was just the [92mperfect[0m amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big [92menough[0m to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the [92mcapers[0m of course paired [92mbeautifully[0m with the smoked salmon. I [92mtried[0m some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor. My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs. I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts. The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich. The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit. This dish itself is enough to make me a regular. I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too. Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.

[91mHandsome[0m [91madmirable[0m brunch [91mblemish[0m. For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely [91mreadjust[0m. Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but [91mdinners[0m is my favorite meal and also what they do best. I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22. I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink. My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice. While waiting for our food, we [91mgulped[0m on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist [91mminimized[0m-muffins, [91mscone[0m, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter. The smoked salmon came with capers, [91mpeppers[0m red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake. There was just the [91mfaultless[0m amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big [91mentirely[0m to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the [91mcaper[0m of course paired [91mterribly[0m with the smoked salmon. I [91mattempted[0m some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor. My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs. I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts. The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich. The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit. This dish itself is enough to make me a regular. I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.

Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, "the host is supposed to do that but I will..." Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. I was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. Casbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices. **Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!

For our last [91mlunch[0m in Pittsburgh we [91mdecided[0m to return to the [91mBig[0m [91mBurrito[0m Group; Eleven was quite [91mgood[0m and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the [91mexperience[0m at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel. Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost [91meverything[0m that [91mtranspired[0m from the [91mmoment[0m we arrived until the [91mmoment[0m we [91mleft[0m was a [91mfailure[0m. When our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and [91minefficient[0m from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never [91meven[0m offered. When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed. With my mom and sister [91mopting[0m for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water. Waiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven. After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes. Finished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be "right out." While I guess she didn't define "right out," what this actually meant was "in 25 minutes." Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive. Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match. Vastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts. Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly. Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes. For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette. For my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette. The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb "Mac and Cheese", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs. Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little. Completing our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time. With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with "just the bill." Settling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years. I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed. He closed with "I hope you will join us again." I will not.

Overall a good experience. Food was mostly very [92mgood[0m. My sweet pea risotto was just OK. My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. Neither of us are big eaters, but noted how small the portions were, especially compared to the price. One cup of risotto for $20+? Four ravioli for the same? They altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call. Service was attentive and the setting nice.

The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits. The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry. Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time? I dare. The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely [92msublime[0m for smoked salmon. The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over. My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage). In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without. A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries. My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Everyone left smiling and satisfied. So, if you haven't given Casbah a try in the last decade, it might be time to visit again. I'm so very glad I did! P.S. Bring your coat into the restroom. It was about 10 below in there. Brrr!

Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm. It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without [91masking[0m where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. I immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. I [91mstarted[0m off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was [91mok[0m. For the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage. For the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok. The cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. Lastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry [91mbread[0m pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it.

While I have [91malways[0m had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today. When my food came out, there was a very visible [91mhair[0m on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. First off, it was not [91meven[0m [91mwarm[0m, so if they [91mmade[0m my [91mmeal[0m on the [91mspot[0m you [91mwould[0m [91mthink[0m it would be [91mhot[0m, or at the very [91mleast[0m warm. I had [91malso[0m [91msubstituted[0m bacon for the sausage that [91mnormally[0m comes with the entree, and if the chef had [91mmade[0m a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially). Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed. in my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. I'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. For me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!

At this time, I have officially had every meal of the day at Casbah (it's [92mgreat[0m!). Here are my thoughts from my three visits: First time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was [92mperfection[0m. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were [92malso[0m [92mheavenly[0m. [92mDefinitely[0m a lovely way to spend my birthday. Second [92mtime[0m was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I [92mgot[0m the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was [92mdelicious[0m this [92mtime[0m, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal! Third time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014) . I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice. All in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons!

They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout. Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture. Usually good music acts here. Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends. Usually 2-3 acts play. Live. And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close. And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music. The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse. I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that. Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there). Sometimes a minimal cover for the music. There are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.

We go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on the menu and [92mnever[0m been disappointed. It's veggie diner food at it's best (at least in my opinion). My bf is a meat & potatoes man but he absolutely loves the breakfast Homefries with tofu instead of eggs. The waitstaff have always been exceptionally nice and very attentive. This establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet, you may find yourself disappointed. On cold wintery days try a Mexican Hot Chocolate - it will surely warm your heart!

I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? Well, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, [91mridiculously[0m slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on! Maybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the "firesticks" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things.

Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake. We had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead.

Sitting there in their mismatched, vintage-y looking diner, I felt like I was in the Mission in SF (OK, maybe minus the fact that everyone was sporting their winter gear, which would never be necessary in CA). Kid friendly too, if that's important to you.

I imagine that this is the restaurant that I would make if I were 20 years old and knew nothing about restaurants except dining in them and what looks and sounds cool. In that it does some things right, but [91mnone[0m of the important things. It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good. They have good music, but [91munfortunately[0m we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place. Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker. I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well. If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume? They had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to. They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I [91mhate[0m choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those. I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful. There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here. I go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note. It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast. As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers "D.C." The waiter replies, "Oh, I'm sorry about that." Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there. So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city. Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are. I was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it. If you're vegan and have literally no other options... then I guess you're going here. If both of those conditions aren't true, then go anywhere else.

Don't expect to get your food on the fly.

I stopped by here today with my fianc\u00e9 for a quick slice of pizza for myself. I had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today. Inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from, a pop cooler, a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside. We were greeted [92malmost[0m immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice. A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza. I was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed. Upon opening it I was [92malso[0m [92mpleased[0m to see that the slice was pretty large. The pizza itself ended up being really solid. On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating. The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy. Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some [92mgood[0m flavor to it. As a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely. The bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in the future. I liked the pizza that I had here and may even order a whole one in the future.

I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. The people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall, i wouldn't go back.

First, it's not bad, for what it is. I like trader Joe's better, I like whole foods better, but this place had stuff I use that the other don't. Nice produce section, items seemed fresh, and plentiful. Mostly organic, and I do like how they label things "local" so that we can help our local farmers, and growers. Great juice bar, salad bar, and hot lunch items. Everything looked appetizing. Great spice and herb section, I bought some freshly ground ginger and some wonderful sweet and smoked paprikas. Good vegan section, tofurkey brands and lightlife products. [92mGood[0m dairy section too, their prices for soy milk is a bit outrageous.

If you've got that talent to create something out of the unexpected, then you HAVE to stop here. I was looking for something unusual to use in my apartment for storage. I had stopped at several big box stores around the city before here and left each one of them in disappointment. I must admit, driving to this place I was a little skeptical. I pulled in and honestly thought that Yelp directed me to a warehouse. But I did not let that deter me from venturing out of my car and into the building. Once you walk inside it is like walking into someone's garage that you just want to rummage through. You know what I mean, you walk in and see all this dingy looking stuff that you see potential in. You want to take it home with you. sometimes you want to polish it up and make it look new, other times you want to let it be and let that distressed look shine through. I easily spent a hour in here just browsing the shelves. I saw potential in a lot of the items I saw lining their shelves. And I took a few items home with me. When I reached the register I was truly [92mfloored[0m by the price. When I say that, it's because it was so low. I was expecting to pay more, but I definitely came out of there with more money in my pocket than I needed to, but that is one sure fired way to make sure that a person returns to your establishment.

This complex is chock [92mfull[0m of all things sportsy...gymnastics, fencing, biking, and yeah, rock climbing!! It's nothing high tech and the first climb is $12 regardless of whether you're a student or a lady on ladies night (I was both). This hike in price is so some guy can explain some basic rules to you for 3 minutes...what a deal. Regardless, the rates are really reasonable (although I've never been to a rock gym before so I could be way off). I climbed in the free fall area without ropes. Climbing courses are marked by colored tape on the walls so you can climb according to your skill level. It's a [92mgreat[0m work out...I can barely move my arms enough to type out this review.

I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing. They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs. Dreams [91mcrushed[0m. Only people that are belay certified can [91meven[0m be in the top rope room. I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice. So we bouldered. The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another. You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss. With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion. Those were only on the overhanging walls. The place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in. I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's). Side note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area. Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully. I expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh.

This place is looking to make money and rip you off. The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection. Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it. Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem. Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you.

It's BYOB and we didn't bring our own wine because we weren't in a drinking mood, but once we sat down we realized this was the kind of place where you needed a bottle of wine. The decor is like an slightly charming mess of old furniture, clean table clothes, and scarves draped over the windows of the converted garage. We sat right by the door and right under the old dresser that the owners stand at. The food was [92mgood[0m. We ordered the tomato garlic bisque, which was delicious. The stuffed peppers with crab and goat cheese were tasty, but the plate was super hot and the peppers were cold, so that was a bit off. For main courses we ordered the salmon and the lobster ravioli. The salmon was [92mgreat[0m. It w cooked well and had a dill cream sauce on it. It was supposed to be served with risotto, but instead came with a dried cake of old creamy looking rice. I ignored that and ate the steamed and grilled veggies they used to garnish the plate. The lobster ravioli was amazing, but instead of coming in it's own sauce, they simply poured on the tomato garlic bisque that we had already ordered as a first course. After reading mixed reviews about this place, I was pleasantly surprised, This place was a hot mess with slightly cold food, but I really liked it.

The adjectives that come to mind when I think of Cafe Zinho are cute, quaint, cozy and in a random area. I don't think I would have stumbled upon this place just upon chance. I made a reservation for three on a Tuesday night at 7. My two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant, which scared me a little bit but I have to have faith in my fellow Yelpers. The waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. You just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey [92mdeliciousness[0m and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that [92mnight[0m which had capers, a [92mpotato[0m, rice and some [92mroasted[0m [92mvegetables[0m. [92mGreat[0m [92mlight[0m combination and not too heavy.

Shopping at Whole Foods this afternoon made us hungry and as we had no plans for dinner, my wife thought of Cafe Zinho, which is nearby. I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly, they had an open table for us. Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one. We made a quick stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe, bought a Spanish red, and showed up at Cafe Zinho. They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine, and brought over two nice stems. The waiter gave us menus, described the daily specials and gave us time to mull it over. We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked). Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread. It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly. The bowls held a hearty [92mserving[0m of the [92mdelicious[0m (and filling) cream soup. After clearing our empty bowls our waiter [92mbought[0m out our entrees. My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go. She was quite pleased with it. It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette. I had a taste and agreed with her assessment. My lamb burger was huge! It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney. It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger. Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger! I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium. It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices. My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy! I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room. My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up. We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us. It was a very nice meal and dining experience. We noticed that the hostess greeted most people who came thru he door by name. Obviously there are a large group of regulars who dine here often. Pros: BYOB, tasty food, reasonable noise level, outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally, friendly and attentive service (if a bit unpolished). Cons: Ambience (it originally was a gas station) and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor, tables are packed every which way into the available interior space.
Shopping at Whole Foods this afternoon made us hungry and as we had no plans for dinner, my wife thought of Cafe Zinho, which is nearby. I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly, they had an open table for us. Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one. We made a quick stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe, bought a Spanish red, and showed up at Cafe Zinho. They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine, and brought over two nice stems. The waiter gave us menus, described the daily specials and gave us time to mull it over. We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked). Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread. It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly. The bowls held a hearty [91mcontributed[0m of the [91mglamorous[0m (and filling) cream soup. After clearing our empty bowls our waiter [91mforfeit[0m out our entrees. My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go. She was quite pleased with it. It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette. I had a taste and agreed with her assessment. My lamb burger was huge! It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney. It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger. Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger! I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium. It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices. My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy! I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room. My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up.

This was the first [91mtime[0m for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is [91mnext[0m to [91mimpossible[0m on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park. The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery. No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu [91mboasts[0m of a [91mdaily[0m vegetarian and [91mvegan[0m special entree, but there was no such [91mentree[0m on this night. There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli. Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did. The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner. A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter. My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces. I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup. All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions. All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server: "chicken maputo Roasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce". Does the average diner know what "maputo" and "piri piri" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream. It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories. The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon. I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant. Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town. The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity. It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site. I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only. Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine. If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us. I posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check. An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out. He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden. Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine. He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense. I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough. I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.

I was thrilled to find a current exhibition of Medieval Persian pottery -- found along the ancient Silk Road route -- currently running as well. Say what you will about H. C.

Considering my absolute love for sweets - and more specifically, ice cream - it just doesn't make [92msense[0m that it took me nearly 6 years of living in Pittsburgh to go to Page Dairy Mart. The only bad thing is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my [92msugar[0m intake to go through the roof now. As you walk up, it's [92measy[0m to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, right? The people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice [92mcream[0m is [92mexcellent[0m! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That "line" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears. A night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and I haven't wanted to go back. Only our conscious willpower has kept us away, and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way, so kudos to Page Dairy Mart and their staff! Heck, it's snowing today, and I'm probably going to go!

Well, [92mlucky[0m for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit.

The [92mHoly[0m Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the [92mbest[0m dipping experience I've ever had. Onto the [92mMEATBALL[0m. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy. Salad course: Great salad! Pasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel... For the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much. I could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. I really cannot wait to go again.

[92mIncredible[0m [92mexperience[0m up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons. I personally love this style of Italian cooking. Sicilian, so folks who are not familiar should take look at their menu online before coming because it might catch you off guard, it isn't what the "normal" Italian restaurant offers. I had a great experience dodging potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it takes the stress out of trying to find parking. Upon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of [92mfreshly[0m prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was [92mbeautiful[0m and really [92mmade[0m realize right then what [92mkind[0m of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were [92mpromptly[0m seated and [92mreceived[0m an explanation of everything that was on the table for our [92menjoyment[0m. The "Holy Oil" was ridiculous and [92malmost[0m addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite. Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. Then be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner. I then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review. I did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork. I wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!

After hearing about AF and reading the reviews, I was expecting an amazing experience. We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally, D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. Homey, old school Italian feel. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing better than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. We were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly [92menjoyed[0m the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However, I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also, this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me, the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall, it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down. For the price, I have had better meals and better service at other restaurants around the city.

My boyfriend & I went to Alla Famiglia for our (late) Valentine's Day dinner last [91mnight[0m. We don't go out & splurge like this often, so we were really excited for a special dinner. The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was [91mabsolute[0m [91mgarbage[0m. I've seriously been [91mtreated[0m [91mbetter[0m at a TGIFriday's. We [91mwaited[0m, [91mpretty[0m much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once [91mseated[0m, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, "[91mUGH[0m, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab." It was 10:30. On a Saturday night. I don't know if it was the [91mfact[0m that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults. When I plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around, I expect to be treated like I'm spending $160 at your restaurant. Despite how great the food was, I won't be returning. SO disappointed.

If it wasn't for how fast and affordable the place is It would have no stars at all. I got a fill and a fix because I broke a nail. First off they didn't cut down my nails so now they are obnoxiously long. Second off they are so thin I feel like they are just going to crack off. Not to mention it seems very dirty.. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. One of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me. I will not be returning again.

DiCarlos is in my opinion THE [92mBEST[0m pizza in the Pittsburgh area. My boyfriend and I will only order DiCarlos if we are in a pizza mood. It's different from your traditional pizza that they only cook the crust with the sauce, all the other toppings are added after it comes out of the oven. The cheese is all melty on the top and it's yum yum delicious! You have to try it. The only other pizza joint that I can think of that is anything similar is Beto's over on Banksville Road in Dormont (or Greentree, where's the line?) This is take out only. No eating there guys. Also, there's not really a "small" option and all of their pizza's are square. If that's a problem, find another pizza joint! I believe they sell calzones and a few other things, but we always [92mgo[0m for the pizza.

The service here can be hit-or-miss, but more often than not, I don't have problems. Usually, when my friend and I stop by, we're waited on by the same server, and our food comes up relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too.

How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy. Randy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch.

The food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT. A really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly).

Great atmosphere of a neighborhood pub, good German beer selection, but food was less than mediocre. Won't be back. Weisswurst was very bland. Sauerbraten was dry and tasteless. Spaetzle was, well, not tradidional German Spaetzle. Schnitzel and purple cabbage were the high points, but then again, it's hard to screw up a fried veal cutlet.

Let me start off by saying that I am unfamiliar with German food. I cannot compare what I had with what is served in Germany, but I will describe my experience. I ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with mini shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a variety of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, bratwurst, and Weisswurst. The portion was [92mlarge[0m! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was [92mgood[0m but doesn't do well as a leftover. My dessert consisted of German chocolate cake. I know, I know...how original. BUT I LOVE GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! And yes, I do know that German chocolate was created in America by a man with the last name of German...STILL LOVE IT!!! I NEED to go back soon so I can try more of their food. One visit isn't enough. I had my sample and I want more!

I ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with mini shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a variety of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, bratwurst, and Weisswurst. The portion was [91mhefty[0m! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was [91mdecent[0m but doesn't do well as a leftover. My dessert consisted of German chocolate cake. I know, I know...how original. BUT I LOVE GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! And yes, I do know that German chocolate was created in America by a man with the last name of German...STILL LOVE IT!!! I NEED to go back soon so I can try more of their food. One visit isn't enough. I had my sample and I want more!

Such a [92mcute[0m [92mhotel[0m! I like to find non-chain hotels, but sometimes that can be scary... The Priory was great!

We only stayed one night, so can't expand too much. Breakfast didn't look too appetizing, so we went elsewhere. The [92mstairs[0m are very squeaky but you can't hear them inside the rooms. The elevator is great. The bar was nice - small, but a great place to stop for a nightcap on your way back in for the evening.

I [92mliked[0m this hotel, but it is something of a mixed bag. Would I stay there again? Yes, but be sure you have a car and are okay with gritty cities. Pros: Beautiful rooms. We stayed in the historical side and had a very nice if not very large room (queen). Some reviewers said they had a mini-frig. Note that not all rooms have those. Breakfast was nice during the week. Hotel was clean. Awesome, fantastic courtyard. You can eat breakfast out there if the weather is nice. Cons: Location. This is not a nice neighborhood. But you can walk to the Strip district, the Warhol Museum, and the stadium. Each room is different. It's a bit like playing the lottery. VERY small shower. Breakfast was less on Sunday, as they rely on local bakeries. It's a true continental. You get yelled at for bringing your own alcohol onto the property. Yeah, we thought that was weird, too. No mention of it on the website, but they don't want you to bring your own drinks into the courtyard.

I was very specific when I made my reservations several months ago. I needed a non-entrance level room away from noise. We were given a room right off of the hotel Foyer. It is mid-night and a party rages just outside my door even though I have called the front desk asking for their assistance. Right now I would prefer to be in a Motel6. This room was relatively not cheap, it should have at least been cut-rate given out only as a last resort.

We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month. My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night. With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant. When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time. We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying. But the main [91missue[0m was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle. We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we [91massumed[0m (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they made our reservation. We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes. We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out. We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it. Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager. She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel. We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this. He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill. It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory. This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.

We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it. Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager. She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel. We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this. He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill. It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory. This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.

First I would like to say the Pasta Too of old had good food, this was just average. The italian and mushroom steak hoagies weren't that great. The steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun. The pizza wasn't that good either. The prices are higher than the food was good. $6.25 for 7" italian and $7.50 for 7" mushroom steak. So not worth it but I guess they figure they can get from the people who work at the hospital and with all the new housing going up. I will not get anything from there again.

And how cool was it that Batman the Dark Knight Raises was also screened here? The massive screen added a layer of epic to the film viewing experience that in no way could be matched by any other theater around town. Tickets for movies at the Omnimax can be purchased separately from the general admission pass to the museum. I recall ticket prices for shows being any where for $9-$12.00. Bonus it's all set up like a movie theater and is accompanied by a concession stand that serves ICEEs. I would not suggest it for very little kids under 5 , the sound is very loud and can prove to be frightening and over whelming. I learned this the hard way.

The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place. The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today. A long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems. I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones. The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall. The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be. The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece. But as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art. The Carnegie Museum of Art includes American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts. The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models. I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints. One special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is "Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs". It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists. So while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Art. To get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day. I did and I still feel like I didn't see everything.

I was trying to decide whether to visit the Carnegie Museum of Art or the Museum of Natural History, and decided to go with the art museum first. Lo and behold, your admission ticket to one gets you into the other at no charge, and they're connected so you don't even have to go outside. [92mScore[0m! So, two great museums for the price of one. The art museum, even on a Saturday afternoon, was not crowded. The galleries don't have the most intuitive layout, and I kept feeling like I was missing something as I walked through the smallish rooms. Still, it was pretty [92measy[0m to find the collections that most interested me. The photography exhibit has some fantastic portraits and slices of Pittsburgh history. The natural history museum, on the other hand, was full of kids of all ages running around among the dinosaur skeletons. I spent less time wandering the exhibits of gemstones and preserved animals than I had spent with the art, but still recommend checking out the badass dioramas of North American and African wildlife.

Lo and behold, your admission ticket to one gets you into the other at no charge, and they're connected so you don't even have to go outside. [91mScoring[0m! So, two great museums for the price of one. The art museum, even on a Saturday afternoon, was not crowded. The galleries don't have the most intuitive layout, and I kept feeling like I was missing something as I walked through the smallish rooms. Still, it was pretty [91muncomplicated[0m to find the collections that most interested me. The photography exhibit has some fantastic portraits and slices of Pittsburgh history. The natural history museum, on the other hand, was full of kids of all ages running around among the dinosaur skeletons. I spent less time wandering the exhibits of gemstones and preserved animals than I had spent with the art, but still recommend checking out the badass dioramas of North American and African wildlife. Overall, a [91mcreditable[0m [91mmisdirection[0m on a larger [91mscales[0m than you'd expect in a [91mcities[0m Pittsburgh's [91msizing[0m, with a [91mpayoff[0m [91mmuseums[0m in the [91mcharge[0m of your ticket.

Us lucky Carnegie Mellon students could get into this museum for free, sooo I managed to make it here once a year. Looking back, I probably should have gone way more.

My favorite part - the gigantic room with all the dinosaur skeletons and the last room in the art galleries with the modern art... there's a really neat blue painting with concentric circles, which tricks your eyes into thinking it's breathing. crazy.

I'm from Detroit. We have a decent art museum, but nothing this awesome. The Carnegie Museum houses two very nice museums. Natural History and Art. The Natural History Museum is very impressive and it's cool knowing that all the specimens belong to the museum and they aren't on loan from some hoity-toity New York museum. It's not huge like the Smithsonian, but it's certainly cool seeing real dinosaur bones. My accompaniment had to stifle all my Jurassic Park "Mr. DNA" references. The art section is also quite impressive. I personally still prefer my Detroit Institute of Art, but this [92mmuseum[0m is [92mstill[0m [92mnice[0m. I got a little confused about how to walk around. I prefer my museums in chronological order, not cool to less cool, which is what this seems to be. The modern art is very cool, but after being at the Warhol the day before, I had my fill of high-concept stuff. There's quite a bit of Impressionism, which by scientific fact all women love. This is great way to spend a long afternoon and there's plenty to do in Oakland afterwards.

Its [91mokay[0m, but it was just ok. There's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard. We were expecting that would be for the table. We started with the polenta and the mozzarella. The mozzarella was [91munremarkable[0m, deep friend mozzarella in breading. Of course it was good, it is fried cheese! But it was nothing special. The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious. They give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil. This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me. Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary. My friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it. I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright. It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent. Overall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana.

I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions. I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us. The inside of the restaurant is actually much [92mtinier[0m than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible. It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us. They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm. Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls. For dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share. It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle. I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta. For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce. Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing. The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal. The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good! It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce. It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it. Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better. The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entr\u00e9e that I had a treat. The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again. I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving.

The best thing about this place is Sam. The [91mworst[0m thing about this place is also Sam. What was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, "You look oriental, but you also look American." I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that. This is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The [91mreason[0m why I'll [91mnever[0m [91mgo[0m there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer. I was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these [91mgood[0m reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, "Why don't you try this instead," and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for. Since the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its "sell by" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway. Stale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh.

While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh.
