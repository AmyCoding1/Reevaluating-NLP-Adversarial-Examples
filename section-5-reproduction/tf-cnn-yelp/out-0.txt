Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money. I don't think I ask much out of a driving range. Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours. Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls. This place has [91mnone[0m of them. It is april and there are no grass tees yet. BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month. The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house. Worn and thread bare. Let's talk about the hours. This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730. It is still light out. Finally lets you have the pit to hit into. When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation. There is no grass on the range. Just mud. Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball. Oh, they are cash only also. Bottom line, this place sucks. The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.

I had such a low expectation I was [92mpleasantly[0m [92msurprised[0m. It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. The guys in the pro shop were two of the [92mfriendlier[0m guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming.... Price for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again.

I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends. Why [91mtwo[0m [91mstars[0m if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight [91mshooter[0m, but an [91mexcited[0m salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it. He told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it. Here's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that. So our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont. A month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. I completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple. Finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! I was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that said "there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow." Well, that didn't happen. Then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. Finally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here. My main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted. Even though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.

Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely [91mdescribe[0m the experiences. On the first trip, I went to try their (at that [91mtime[0m)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it. Well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben. The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment. I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops. We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal. The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets. Thank goodness for the basic salad bar. Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag. The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh. Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds. From what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.

Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 [92mstar[0m [92mrating[0m for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.

My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to [91mlike[0m this place, I really did...however, I didn't. The food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5. The service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5. The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5. The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5. So in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.

There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state "[92mfull[0m [92mkitchen[0m" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and [92mpans[0m, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. The room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. The best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile. I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it.

No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that "they were out". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.

Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. To recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me? It's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!! Same [91mlousy[0m service. My guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. I really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. Get it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ; ). Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music. And fun patrons.

Some of the [91mworst[0m [91mpizza[0m I've ever had. We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't [91meven[0m cut through, and the [91msad[0m attempt at cutting was so [91muneven[0m that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4" each. The [91mtoppings[0m were [91mscarce[0m, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge [91mchunks[0m and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick [91mdoughy[0m [91mcrust[0m that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. We also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The "steak" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. I have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!

He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way. Meaning, for example- I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them. Most placed will have bulges and puckers. The rest of my items were just as perfect. Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem. The items were done in a timely manner. He takes his business very seriously. While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price. Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town!

He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions. As for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. The workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking.

I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. From the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly [91minexperienced[0m and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently [91mwell[0m, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago. But it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point). I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water. My biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all. And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their "mistake" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night). My opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.

Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night). My opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.

Outrageous ! There is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. I will most likely not return.

My friend said "An apology would be a good start" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said "Get out and don't come back" ???????? Are you kidding???? My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. That being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite. There are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town. Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!! Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's.

THE [91mWORST[0m [91mDENTAL[0m [91mEXPERIENCE[0m OF MY LIFE. THEY ARE BUTCHERS! My husband and I [91mwent[0m to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up. I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled. After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible. I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The "dentist" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction. After they gave me novocaine they get me with "you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this "bone graft". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The "dentist" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest. Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft. I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions. I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night. I refused to go back to Emmert Dental. And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth. They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth. Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain. Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work. They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily. I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in. I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer. I expect and want a full refund. No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru. They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant. Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental. And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals. In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy. They are crooks and butchers.

I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has [91mrun[0m out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not [91meven[0m [91mworth[0m it. This McDonalds is [91mpoo[0m and so is most of the staff. Whenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. Today was a [91mhorrible[0m day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,"Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but I refused because I had just had enough. There are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on! I'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!

If you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this [91mnasty[0m bottle. Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly. Aside from that, good coffee and fast/friendly service.

I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the [91msmall[0m, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult ([91mespecially[0m in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area.

She's incredibly nice and leads me to the felt. This is not the first time I've been hard up to find help. I tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that they're "low on payroll" and can't have any one the floor BUT HER! In that WHOLE store, JUST HER! That's ridic! Not a month ago I was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, I gave up and walked out.

The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably [91mdismal[0m. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. I stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. Plus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to.

Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch. What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them. I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container. After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away. When I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed. The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered. The "steakburger" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it. It was all I could taste. All this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.

You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know.

I haven't been back in over year, and I will never [91mstep[0m [91mfoot[0m into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. After having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right...."You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her "bathroom break", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach.

Also know some pretty obscure songs. My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.

I couldn't [91meven[0m walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!

When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place. On top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day. The hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line. Finally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. I had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. After dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. All in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.

If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.

Compared to Playdium here, that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food.

My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't [91mthink[0m we'll be back.

We stood in line for over 20 [91mminutes[0m before being [91mtold[0m that there was another attendant in the [91mactual[0m game room. [91mNeedless[0m to [91msay[0m, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!

I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place. - None of the food was super awesome.

First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location. Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have [92malways[0m [92mfound[0m their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has [92malways[0m been [92mtasty[0m and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all. Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that. Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty. I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian. Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.

Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have [91mperpetually[0m [91mfaced[0m their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has [91mpersistently[0m been [91mdelish[0m and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all. Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that. Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty. I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian. Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.

Nice outdoor seating in the [91msummertime[0m. This is a [91msizeable[0m place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your [91mbeverage[0m cold. I know they have other cocktails here, but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good, but I'm stuck to the beer selection. They have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week. Service is always great whether there are two or 10 of us.

BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. I came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalape\u00f1o cheese dip. I was [92mblown[0m away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered [92mwithin[0m 25 minutes of seating.

Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved.

My friends & I all purchased Groupons for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name [91mcomedians[0m were listed on the Improv's [91mwebsite[0m as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on [91manything[0m that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a [91mconfirmation[0m [91mcode[0m & everything! Shortly after, they [91mchanged[0m many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. So tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? In addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. My friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. The Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.

The place does what it does best - Comedy. The food, however. [91mBlah[0m. First off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item [91mper[0m person minimum. This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each. Second, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS! I learned that one the hard way.

I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%. Overall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show. I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.

The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end). The setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV. The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an [91mOK[0m atmosphere to see a show and laugh. It's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy. Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit). But the biggest problem is the food and drink. They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show. The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad. You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place. I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it. Still, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians. Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements. A few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed: 1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them. I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here. Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear. It's not that hard. 2 - Put the drink prices on the website too. An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said "Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!" I'm calling shenanigans. Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning. 3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me. It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers. 4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask "would you like a refill on that?" or anything of the sort. They should ask "would you like another one?" instead. They should also respond to requests for refills by saying "we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one." Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out. Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.

It was a huge [91mpile[0m of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. The comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our "event". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience. My car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole. The Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.

It isn't often that my wife and I get to go out, but we had tickets to [91msee[0m the WONDERFUL Lisa Landry and figured since we were going to the Improv, we may as well eat there too. I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a [91mpaper[0m menu with 4 [91mitems[0m on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't [91moffer[0m us one [91meither[0m. She wanted our [91morder[0m, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! "What about our food?", we asked. "Oh", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was "do you want me to take your food back?". Really?!?! "Do you want me to take your food back?" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no. The service didn't get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back? Don't know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day.

It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day.

She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she "definitely" put our order in so it "must have been given to someone else by mistake." Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously? The waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course. However, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.

At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table. 2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving. 3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working. It's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.

All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers. I am giving it one [91mstar[0m, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be [91mdesired[0m. This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond [91mridiculous[0m. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.

It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out.

They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers.

We ended up spending a fortune on beer and [91mmediocre[0m appetizers. I only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\u00e9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience. I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. Overall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.

Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I [91mguess[0m this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. It's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. Tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy. I'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.

I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa. This [91mlocation[0m [91mneeds[0m a [91mlot[0m of work. We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv. We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat. We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received. We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not [91meven[0m 3/4 full. There were also plenty of [91mempty[0m tables. This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction. But we grabbed a table. I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes. Then we got our drinks at 7:04. The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour. That went out the window. When our friends for there; they ordered drinks. We finished them and left. The server was nice, that is not the issue. The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were. They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers. The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with "this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped". That is a sign that you need more staff. I have never had this happen at any other bar before. Get more staff. We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing. Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55. We ended up going to the Improv and got food there. Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.

I don't frequent Bar Louie, and I really don't plan to change that any time soon. I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place. The food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never "wowed" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way [91moverpriced[0m here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area. Still, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool. So while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon.

Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun. So to say the least, I was a [92mbit[0m [92mnervous[0m coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen. I seriously had SO MUCH [92mfun[0m here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. There was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :) The food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. Overall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)

Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just "[91mokay[0m" for me. I really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or "family" because there isn't [91mmuch[0m fun here for people older than 16. The water slides here were lacking. There were very few of them and the majority of them are boring. The last time I was there (not too long [91mago[0m) there weren't any [91mextremely[0m modern [91mslides[0m like a tornado [91mslide[0m, so they really have some updating to do. They do have an "adult pool" and bar area but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area. The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. It has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. It wasn't too impressive to me. They also have a lazy river at this park and, while I do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe. People kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out. The one attraction that I did enjoy was the wave pool. It was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably. The water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. I could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park. Overall, this place is just mediocre. It doesn't "wow" me very much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun.

As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!! He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us! Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night.

I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore. Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this. My husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch. We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us. My husband is a meat lover, so I [91magreed[0m to let him order us a meat-covered pizza. To counteract this a little, I [91mordered[0m a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix. When the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture. The menu description is thus: "chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup." This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate "drizzling" of balsamic syrup. It looks light and yummy. What we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese. It was DISGUSTING. There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad. I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing. Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10. $10 for complete inedible slop. The "numero uno" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either. It was ok... very mediocre. The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever. I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing. The ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there. It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort. They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options. I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however. If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.). Their hearts will applaud you. And lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs? Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about? It's baffling.

The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. The personal pizzas alone were $11 each...

Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. I went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. The girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one. So I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying "Soooo, you DON'T want these???" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! After that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). The thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever.

When I lived in Los Angeles a year and a half ago, P F Chang's was no great shakes, one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu. Here in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines [92mgenuinely[0m [92mgood[0m service with quality food. Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here. The Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with [92mdelicious[0m fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles. Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too. Their fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like. Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do. Portions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came. The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees. If you live in LA, forget P F Chang's. If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block. But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around.

REDO! I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT [91mpleased[0m with the [91mfood[0m that was presented to me. My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese [91mfood[0m. My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just [91mreinvented[0m American [91mfood[0m with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat. So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this [91mcaricature[0m of a Chinese restaurant. There were very few people in the restaurant. The two of us were seated in the largest corner [91mbooth[0m and left to review our menus. When our [91mwaitress[0m finally arrived we ordered the following items: [91mCoca[0m Cola [91mIced[0m Tea Pan fried pork dumplings Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup Changs chicken with white rice Our drinks and my soup came out immediately. Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything. I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table. I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table. I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know. Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was. I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye. My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils. The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself. I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown. I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server. It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow. I saw no reason to continue. I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them. The skins were a bit thick and doughy. The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all. The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off. I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid. We finished our dumplings. Our lunch entrees arrived. I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best. The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else. I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified. This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken. Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place. It is always different. Many of them are good in different ways. This food, though, it wasn't good. Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar. I just don't understand how anyone can like this place. Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.

The front staff was [91mrude[0m, and the wait was too long. Tonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance.

I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating). After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables. What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them? The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price. We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.

Last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died. Obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.

But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.

My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang's and stay on a vegan diet. Vegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress [92mwithout[0m hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu. Warning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as [92mdelicious[0m and the chicken. They also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables. I always loved the fact PF Chang's offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so well with their meals. The service staff at Chang's is always top shelf, I've never had a bad time here and love when we go.

So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a [92mhuge[0m fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. We came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily [92mtime[0m went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.

Let me start by saying that I do like their food. Last night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was [91mundercooked[0m, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice. (is that the way rice is prepared now?) I ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better. 4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.

I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is [92mpretty[0m [92mgood[0m. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast. The food is typical PF Chang's: [92mdelicious[0m. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also [92mnice[0m to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some [92mcomplain[0m about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of "Chinese" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entr\u00e9es and have never been disappointed. I've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones. The only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang's, included.

My husband's dish was [91mOK[0m. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(

This use to be my go to Panera Bread. When I worked in the area I would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well.

I recently stopped back here when I was shopping and was [92mpleasantly[0m [92msurprised[0m. With all my new allergies I came in here hoping to get some bread. Not knowing, nor doing my homework before I showed up, I asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not. Not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included. After looking through it for a few minutes I was able to select the bread I wanted. They will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now. If you would rather slice yourself, I am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way. Yes, it's true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf. But it is much better tasting.

Although it does not seem to have every single item as other stores I'm still able to get in and get out in a hurry.

Let's [91mstart[0m this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits. Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding. 1- They [91mnever[0m [91mcontacted[0m us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call. The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone. 2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting. 3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said "Oh... I don't know" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say "Let me check that for you") he instead said "Well, I'm going to hang up now." And he made good on that promise, and hung up. 4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to. 5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know. Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect. 6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white. Another received no studs. We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization. 7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate "I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?" to which she responded "Yeah that should be fine" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard. 8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when he informed her of said late fee. 9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse. Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it. Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told "Oh, that isn't for this. That is intended for YOUR wedding. Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year." 10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion. He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it. When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use. Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week. Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was "Effing Men's Wearhouse." For example, at a restaurant, "Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!" "Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse." Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me "I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding" to which I replied "Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA" Congrats Men's Wearhouse. You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits. TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.

For example, at a restaurant, "Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!" "Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse." Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me "I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding" to which I replied "Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA" Congrats Men's Wearhouse. You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits. TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.

I mean, where else can you get discounted Bliss products?? I generally don't have a lot of success with shoes at TJ Maxx because they never seem that discounted to me, but I have struck gold at this location several times. Last summer I scored two pairs of Cole Haan wedges for under $40 at the beginning of summer, and I've had success with booties here as well. Great deals on shoes makes me a happy girl! All in all, this is a great location, and one that I frequent at least a few times per month.

This is one of the few restaurants I frequent in the Waterfront. Why would you come to Mitchell's if not for the fish/seafood? You probably wouldn't. But you can swim in the Great Lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is [92mnever[0m to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly [92mromantic[0m dinner with your loved one(s). The food is very [92mgood[0m but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell's at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.

The bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me. After announcing the reason for my visit, she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables. No offer of water, or a drink. Another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up. He then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up. He placed a glass of water in front of me. Then I hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff. 3 staff members yelled. . ."it's TAKEOUT" so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up. Gentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not) After more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?) it finally is put down in front of me. She then rings me up. I don't expect take out to be piping hot, but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room. When i go to eat my meal, utensils were not included. I now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with. VERY DISAPPOINTING experience. Will not be returning.

Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt "bad where I hope they improve."

Seared [91mahi[0m [91mtuna[0m: [91mhorrible[0m flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi. NOT good. With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest. The chef should do so. (He's a nice guy like me I hope.) BBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer. It is chilled, very delicious. This appetizer was recommended and was garbage. The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate. Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce. A real "must-miss". Cod entree was OK. The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans. Potato skin had grit in the mashed. Why 1 star? The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine. I hope they spruce it up. The place is nice.

I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. With that said, this is probably the [91mworst[0m Dick's location that I've ever been to. The selection is very [91mlimited[0m for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players. The staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it's the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don't have what we're looking for). They do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a "good" Dick's location.

Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble. I concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it.

It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took. While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly. The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot. Everyone in the table resented me for "holding back" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger. Which hey works as a segway onto the burger. Quesadilla Burger. I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways. The patty was sorta flavorful. The toppings were in the [91mbland[0m category. Cheese went MIA. And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless. A big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits.

The advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).

I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza. My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them. I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area. Whenever I called to place my order I was [91mtold[0m that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant. You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from. Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there. My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me "Stay out of trouble". I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else. The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it. The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy. Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening. The bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future. I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.

My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very [91minattentive[0m to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.
My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very [92moblivious[0m to detail.

It had a homey feeling ..... My boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about. My entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. There were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. The service was great. All in all it was an amazing experience. The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it . This is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and it is very private.Not to dressy and not too casual. Pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown. Im pretty sure my boyfriend and i will be going back.

I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call. And I am definitely not estimating the time, either. I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving. Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, "Oh hi. Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most. I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.' Seriously? When I was waiting, another woman came to the door. I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in! When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place. I couldn't believe it.

The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.

I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited. The clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. Shopping here is a gold find!!

They made my Portuguese Water Dog look [91mhorrible[0m. They actually sheared all the fur from my dog [91mclaiming[0m that it was matted and therefore they had no [91mchoice[0m.

Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. I never expected them to just shear the dog to the skin. I think they did it because they are [91mhopelessly[0m irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this [91mbrutally[0m simple [91moperation[0m they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears. I used Animal Elegance for more than a decade. Long before current management took over. Over all these years I sometimes took in stride their accessional compromise of standards and always paid their exorbitant prices without complaint. However, this fragrant negligence, combined with their total disregard of the fact that I was an old and loyal customer did it. I will avoid this place from now on and would like to suggest that you do the same.

Oh, and the cost is about $45-50, which I'd say is average for most groomers I've gone to.

I wound up here the other night after walking down the street because of a 45 minute wait at Point Brugge Cafe.

The menu is rather expansive, but mainly focuses on Italian fare with an occasional jab at the more popular Pointe Brugge up the street: mussels and fries. It happened to be lasagna night. Because I am used to the home cooked variety, I had a hard time shelling out $18 for lasagna. I selected the wild mushroom and spinach option and it also came with the soup of the day, which happened to be gumbo. Both were very good. The gumbo had a very earthy taste along with good amounts of sausage, jumbo lump crab, and risotto mixed in. Rather than being the layered the lasagna was one giant noodle, the size of the entire plate, stuffed with a generous amount of mushrooms and spinach folded over itself with marinara and cheese. Didn't get a chance to try dessert. Both items I had were rather tasty, and I would easily come back here for a great meal.

I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace. [91mBad[0m idea. My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and "Italian frites." The latter, which the menu described as "fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic," were basically just regular-ass french [91mfries[0m - [91mdecent[0m, but nowhere [91mnear[0m worth their $6 price tag. The greens and beans were even more of a [91mrip[0m-off: 8 FREAKIN' [91mDOLLARS[0m for a smallish bowl of [91mrather[0m flavorless produce. Talk about a profit margin! As a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper. It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers. Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a "nice" restaurant? Classless. Conclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's.

Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is [91muninspired[0m and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be [91mmaking[0m that mistake again.

I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night. I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they [92mmade[0m the interior beautiful. We made reservations, but I don't think we would have [92mneeded[0m them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in. My two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good. We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely [92mdelicious[0m prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella. This was an [92mimpressive[0m way to start out the meal. We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer. This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny. The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order. It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish. I ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it. I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night. Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable. My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce. Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on. Talk about service! The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5. Added bonus: Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen. Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).

I decided to [92mtry[0m Pino's due to the restaurant week special and boy am I [92mglad[0m that I did! My husband and I made reservations for four on Friday night. We were seated almost [92mimmediately[0m on the lovely outdoor patio area. It was a [92mgreat[0m [92mnight[0m to be outside. Although the restuarant is [92msmall[0m, the ambiance is [92mwonderful[0m. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well. The table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were [92mable[0m to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well. Overall, I would definitely recommend Pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in Point Breeze. However, I wish they offered the 3 course menu as a regular feature.
I decided to [91mtrying[0m Pino's due to the restaurant week special and boy am I [91mravi[0m that I did! My husband and I made reservations for four on Friday night. We were seated almost [91mimmediatly[0m on the lovely outdoor patio area. It was a [91msuper[0m [91mnighttime[0m to be outside. Although the restuarant is [91mtiny[0m, the ambiance is [91mgrandiose[0m. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well. The table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were [91mpotential[0m to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected.

My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town, we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good. Verdict? It was so-so. We had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated OUTSIDE! Listen folks, it's COLD when the sun goes down. They have three tables set outside, I guess trying to squeeze out some more business. Our server was [91mnice[0m, but not [91mattentive[0m at all. We were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all. The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary.

My friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? We tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse. I don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there.

He then snidely [91mcommented[0m, as [91mwalking[0m [91maway[0m, that he would "never salt his steak again". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so [91mrudely[0m to my mother.

So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. The drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. Overall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.

I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has. Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself. Finding things takes work. My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most [91millogical[0m layouts that I've seen. It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything. Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible. Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze: 1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce. Normal enough. 2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy. Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery. 3.) From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall. Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8). 4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove. A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store). 5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave. Most of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up. You're not going every which way to try and find things. Also, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said. Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store. However, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was. There is a reason that store was nicknamed "the dirty bird." Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.
I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has. Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself. Finding things takes work. My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most [92mcounterintuitive[0m layouts that I've seen. It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything. Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible. Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze: 1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce. Normal enough. 2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy. Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery. 3.) From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall. Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8). 4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove. A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store). 5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave. Most of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up. You're not going every which way to try and find things. Also, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said. Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store. However, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was. There is a reason that store was nicknamed "the dirty bird." Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.

Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had. It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever. Honestly, I only went here because I was at Target and didn't want to venture any further to complete my shopping.

This Giant Eagle seems more like a GetGo than an actual supermarket. As soon as you get in you want to get out as quickly as possible. You don't want to do any major grocery shopping here. For one, the prices are high. Secondly, this Giant Eagle does not carry everything you need. Who has time to run to another store? Just get your basic necessities here. As for produce, it can be [91mawful[0m at times. Whenever I go to Giant Eagle Market District down the street, the produce is fresh and smells invigorating. However, at Shakespeare, you are bound to find produce with wrinkles, open areas, mold and fruit flies- being sold at the same high prices. I can go to Trader Joe's and find much better produce for less. A pet peeve of mine is the self-checkout lines. Two of them are express lanes for items less than 12; the other lane has a belt if more than 12 items are being purchased. There should be TWO LINES but for some reason customers want to form one long super line, which holds up everything. The staff rarely sorts this out. The customer service is average here and I don't expect it to get any better. I only go here if I have to grab one or two items. The best times to go are early in the morning or late at night.

My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. The "stylist" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said "sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line" and the lady said "oh we don't do that." WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. And waited, and waited, while one "stylist" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been "on break," or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said "after I'm done here," and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving.

We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not [91mslices[0m. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked [91mterribly[0m) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_- It also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!

I do wish however that it was a little thicker. Maybe add some more lettuce and tomatoes for fullness. By the time we got it home it was like eating a lunch meat sandwich. Still delicious but I would have like a little more bite in my hoagie. The interior is a little outdated but they have a bunch of steeler memorabilia hanging up. Also, if you like to play the lottery they have a small window for buying and playing the numbers. Waste of money if you ask me but to each his own. BTW, IT'S CASH ONLY HERE, but they do have an ATM.

The damage was minimal, but after calling it into my insurance company, they directed me to come here. Within minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that Mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate. I set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my day. When I arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task. My wait was minimal, the staff were polite and I wasn't being jerked around. Within five minutes of them looking at my car, I was out the door and heading back to my place. Unfortunately, they did not do any work to my vehicle at this point because the police are still looking into the person that hit my car. But if we get to that step, I am confident that they could not do anything wrong in my eyes. If their body work for a vehicle is anything like their customer service, they are definitely one of the best places to go in the city. Yes people, this isn't the best neighborhood in the city, but get over it.

A few days after that (Monday), I took my car in for the repair. It did take a couple days longer than they said, which is really the only negative thing I can say about Mike's, but considering I didn't have to pay for the rental car, it wasn't a huge deal. When I did get my car back (Thursday), like others have said, it was in even better condition than when I took it in (besides the dent, of course)! They had cleaned/waxed the outside, and even cleaned and detailed the inside! If they just did detailing, I would take my Impreza there every time! Mike's rules!

I love, love, love my puppy. After visiting every shelter in the city and finding nothing, we came back the next day after seeing a posting for a 2 month old terrier mix. Our poor little guy had been dumped in a park and some very nice person brought him to the ARL who took him in, waited 3 days for someone to claim him, and neutered him. He wasn't even supposed to be on the floor yet when we got there, but they were super helpful and brought him out to us and let us take him home. The staff there were [92msuper[0m helpful and wonderful to my incredibly anxious fiance- imagine a first time dad bringing home the baby! The only reason they only get 4 stars is my poor puppy is SO sick. We've had him for 3 weeks and he's got an awful cough that hasn't been responsive to any antibiotics. I know its hard to keep all the dogs isolated, but I really think 8 weeks is a little too early to neuter a puppy especially after being found in a park- too much stress! Hopefully our little guy starts getting better soon, we're awfully worried about him! Still love the ARL though!

Please do not [91madopt[0m any pets from here until they update their standards. I [91mhate[0m to think of animals living in cages, but... !! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !! AKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not [91mwashing[0m hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens. I recently adopted a kitten from their [91mshelter[0m--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption [91mstation[0m. I was told that he had been tested for common feline [91mviruses[0m and up-to-date on vaccinations. These were both untrue statements. The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this. My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus. They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. Furthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records. I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now. They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better. Where's the compassion for the animal? So now I have a very sick kitten on my hands. I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best. She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter. The Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this. After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat?? And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance. It will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. Had I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter. That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did. Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI. This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food. It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please! Oh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life. Poor little guy. This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future. Bad shelter!

I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring. During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed [92mgenuinely[0m [92mhappy[0m for me. Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting. A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter). I contacted the shelter and they practically bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues. The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing. In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly. Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions. I would highy suggest adopting from this shelter. I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok. The shetler staff care deeply about the animal AND the human's well-being!

I've had such good experiences with ARL, that I will probably return here again and again. Years ago we adopted a mutt of a puppy that turned out to be the [92mbest[0m dog that I could have [92mever[0m imagined. But let me talk about my most recent visit. While browsing Facebook, I noticed that they were having an event at ARL. This particular event was called the Free Fur All. The event involved free adoption to qualified adopters, free micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and [92mgoodies[0m for both human and furry companions. I had plans to get Little Man E microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free. Hot damn, you know I was in line. It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night. Once we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes. It's a very quick thing to have done. Little Man E didn't even flinch. He was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade. I have to give huge kudos to the staff there. They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet. It's like they talk their language. I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!). Once done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath). We visited one of the tables and E selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that. This place is amazing for so many different pet oriented things. I'll definitely be coming back here whenever I need something for LME.

Never again. Let me repeat, [91mnever[0m again. The primary [91mreason[0m I [91mused[0m to [91mvisit[0m this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their [91mrepeated[0m [91minability[0m and ineptness in fulfilling simple [91mrequests[0m, I cannot continue to patronize this store. Walking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy "guilty-until-proven guilty" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store [91massumes[0m everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo. The [91mpharmacy[0m seems to be staffed by high school interns. They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy. I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for. The first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers. i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card. After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer. I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior. When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up "maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in." Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance. The latest of many "adventures" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill. We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow. Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up. I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription. But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment. We then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior. We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us. After searching around for a few minutes, they "found" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready. Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared. Hence, I am now here, writing this review. Never, ever again.
Never again. Let me repeat, [92mnon[0m again. The primary [92mraison[0m I [92mutilizes[0m to [92msightseeing[0m this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their [92mreproduces[0m [92mshortfall[0m and ineptness in fulfilling simple [92mdemand[0m, I cannot continue to patronize this store. Walking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy "guilty-until-proven guilty" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store [92msignifies[0m everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo. The [92mchemist[0m seems to be staffed by high school interns. They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy. I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for. The first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers. i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card. After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer. I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior. When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up "maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in." Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance. The latest of many "adventures" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill. We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow. Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up. I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription. But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment. We then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior. We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us. After searching around for a few minutes, they "found" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready. Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared. Hence, I am now here, writing this review. Never, ever again.

I experienced three main issues with this Goodyear location while purchasing/installing a new set of tires: -They did not have my name or appointment in their system when I showed up. Fortunately, they still honored my appointment. -They did not install tires correctly. Left for a business trip the following day, and once I got on the highway and my speed passed 65 mph, the car began to rattle (with my new "comfort tread" tires). Booked an appointment, and they fixed the issue. -Two months later, I went to my Toyota dealership for routine maintenace. The [91mdealer[0m mechanic found that the lugnuts on the tires had been over torqued by Goodyear. So the Toyota mechanic had to saw them off of each tire and replace them with non-security locked nuts. (If I had a flat on the side of the road, I would have been SOL). All of these issues were entirely preventable. The lack of expertise and techincal skill at this Goodyear location is abysmal. I do not recommend.

I was just there this morning for a 10am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires. My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday. Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable, so I said [91mOK[0m. Upon arrival, store manager [91mstated[0m that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts. He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not [91mguarantee[0m the work. I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty. I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it. Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue. Last time I ever set foot in that place.

In addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful. All that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day.
