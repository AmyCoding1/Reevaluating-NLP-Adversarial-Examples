A nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood, Enrico's was the [92mperfect[0m spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed. My wife and I both got lattes and pastries, and [92meverything[0m was [92mgood[0m to go. It looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there, rooted to a chair. We got the next to last free table. Almost every "two-top" had only one person sitting at it. I would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes. Recommend! P.s. I thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here.

I'm a gym guy. I go 3 or 4 times a week among other workouts and activities. [91mRegulars[0m Always towels Very [91mhygienic[0m Always cardio equipment open Pools/hot tub Lots of lockers [91mJovial[0m staff Lots of classes Lots of [91mlibre[0m wights Next to target and [91mtrading[0m joes Even during peek hours it's [91mnope[0m over crowded Cons When the old lady's come in they take up all the parking spots some how. But that's not the [91mgym[0m [91mblame[0m Only one flat bench press Since they have pools and a kids activities some times kids wonder into the wight areas So in the end more pros then cons. This is more just nit picking but as all gyms have them. There are a few weirdos who are members and just take up space more then workout but oh well what can ya do about it.

In the last week I've been here twice, partially because I don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty [92mgood[0m! It's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.

The sauce was pretty mild but [92mstill[0m [92mquite[0m [92mtasty[0m and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap.

Who makes a new girl work on a Friday night! She seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because I wasn't hungry anymore so I didn't care. The beer was pricy - Tuesday night I had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer...

I found Buffalo Blues to be [91mmerely[0m [91mOK[0m. I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small. I actually liked the wing sauces I tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic). Our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive. I would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night. For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the [91mfood[0m was [91mOK[0m. Surprisingly, lots of vegetarian options. A vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.

My local sports bar. It has the prefered sound and enough televisions so no matter how busy it is, my neck isn't cramped and I don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game. It is a bar. It has bar food. Nothing really stands out for me in the realm of fries, sandwhiches and wings. On the other hand, I've [92mnever[0m had a [92mbad[0m experience either. So when I eat there, I'm not anticipating dissapointment or spectacular, but I am expecting constantcy. Consistancy is what is delivered. Buffalo Blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics. Service is spotty, I do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when I go there. The plus is, when specific staff is working, the place is that much of a better establishment. Consistantly just above average in my opinion. I chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment. 5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues. I would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich I'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars.

My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty "[91mmeh[0m" experience for me. We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought. It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area. I went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy. The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp. The sandwich left something to be desired. It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich. The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy. There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor, It was just belly-filler, really. I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here. I just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8. I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8. Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem. But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home. Buffalo Blues was neither. Not particularly interested in returning for any reason.
