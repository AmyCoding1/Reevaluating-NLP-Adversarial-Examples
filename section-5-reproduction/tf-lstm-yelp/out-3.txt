I imagine that this is the restaurant that I would make if I were 20 years old and knew [91mnothing[0m about restaurants except dining in them and what looks and sounds cool. In that it does some things right, but [91mnone[0m of the [91mimportant[0m [91mthings[0m. It has a [91mdecent[0m sized [91mshop[0m with [91mlarge[0m windows and its bright, so that's good. They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place. Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too [91mloud[0m for the people close to the speaker. I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well. If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume? They had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to. They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those. I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful. There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here. I go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note. It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast. As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers "D.C." The waiter replies, "Oh, I'm sorry about that." Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there. So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city. Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are. I was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it. If you're vegan and have literally no other options... then I guess you're going here. If both of those conditions aren't true, then go anywhere else.

I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a [91mparody[0m of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd. A small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But "Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings" is not [91mfood[0m to me. Yep, that description of their "chorizo" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed "foods." Less processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, "Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat"? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: "Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?" Two stars because I really like the drinks here. The ones I remember trying were the ginger lemonade, the Mexican hot chocolate, and the root beer with a shot of espresso. They have some really wonderful sounding tea options that I wish I could try, but I generally avoid this place because of the food.

I love N.Y. style pizza. Could eat it every day. On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was [92mgood[0m pizza. One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style: the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese. As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce. The sum of its parts is still a [92mdelicious[0m close cousin to NYC pizza. The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of [92mfavorites[0m: Fiori's Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch) Pizza Perfectta Aiello's (Murray Street) Beto's Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious. Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's. A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh. Pizza Perfectta has a few stools and a counter but really it is a take-out place.

I stopped by here today with my fianc\u00e9 for a quick slice of pizza for myself. I had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today. Inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from, a pop cooler, a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside. We were greeted almost immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice. A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza. I was [92mhappy[0m to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed. Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large. The pizza itself ended up being really solid. On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating. The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy. Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it. As a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely. The bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in the future. I liked the pizza that I had here and may even order a whole one in the future.

Construction Junction is an [92mincredible[0m [92mexperience[0m! Just drive a block off Penn Ave in Point Breeze, pull into a fenced-in parking lot, and head toward a little door attached to a deserted-looking warehouse. The little door opens into an old, dusty space filled with used home items. Don't forget to check out the crazy pieces of artwork suspended from the ceiling as you walk through! The warehouse has a range of items from treasures to no-one-would-ever-buy-this pieces. Today I saw: -fabulous 1960s desks -old scratched and/or locked filing cabinets -retail display cases -disassembled kitchen cabinets and countertops -ancient (and very [92mintriguing[0m) appliances -hundreds of toilets and bathroom sinks -random bathroom and kitchen tiles -carpet remnants -lots and lots of random chairs -light fixtures varying in quality from brilliant chandeliers to barely-operational The list just goes on and on and on. Take the oddness of this list and multiply it by 3... then you're getting close to imagining what Construction Junction is like. Make sure to enter this store with zero expectations, no particular items to buy, and an empty home. Sadly, my home is filled (though I really wanted that 1960s desk...), and I had an item to buy (a filing cabinet). We left empty handed and drove straight to Office Depot, where I purchased a $90 (vs $25 here) filing cabinet that was not locked, had smooth-running drawers, and is not scratched up. Even though I didn't find what I needed today, I cannot wait to return here in the future.

Pros: - At least there's a climbing gym in this area - Walls get reset often Cons: - I've been [91mcoming[0m here a couple [91mtimes[0m a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is [91mreally[0m [91mdisappointing[0m because it [91mruins[0m my climbing [91mexperience[0m. - I brought up the aforementioned [91mlack[0m of mats to the woman who works here, and she [91msnapped[0m at me: "Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped." I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly "If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them." I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. - The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. - The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. - The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here.

[91mWorst[0m climbing gym I have ever been to. Customer service was a joke. Wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the 80s and then did nothing since then. Holds are prehistoric and grimy. Setting is subpar. Insurance doesn't allow for people who can't belay to be belayed? Better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump..

I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing. They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs. Dreams crushed. Only [91mpeople[0m that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room. I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice. So we bouldered. The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and [91mthough[0m the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another. You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss. With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion. Those were only on the overhanging walls. The place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in. I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's). Side note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area. Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully. I expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh.

There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was [91mquite[0m [91mdisappointed[0m. I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects. First of all, the gym in pretty cheap. And the bouldering area is really quite good. To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area. Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. It seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent. I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon. The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. Now the downsides. The staff wasn't very helpful. The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test. It's poor form. The ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull. They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground. I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. The walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible. Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned. Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous. There's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean. I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity.

The stuffed peppers with crab and goat cheese were tasty, but the plate was super hot and the peppers were cold, so that was a bit off. For main courses we ordered the salmon and the lobster ravioli. The salmon was great. It w cooked well and had a dill cream sauce on it. It was supposed to be served with risotto, but instead came with a dried cake of old creamy looking rice. I ignored that and ate the steamed and grilled veggies they used to garnish the plate.

[92mShopping[0m at Whole Foods this afternoon made us hungry and as we had no plans for dinner, my wife thought of Cafe Zinho, which is nearby. I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly, they had an open table for us. Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one. We made a [92mquick[0m stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe, bought a Spanish red, and showed up at Cafe Zinho. They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine, and [92mbrought[0m over two nice stems. The waiter gave us menus, described the [92mdaily[0m [92mspecials[0m and gave us time to mull it over. We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked). Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread. It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly. The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious (and filling) cream soup. After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees. My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go. She was quite pleased with it. It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette. I had a taste and agreed with her assessment. My lamb burger was huge! It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney. It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger. Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger! I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium. It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices. My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy! I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room. My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up. We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us. It was a very nice meal and dining experience. We noticed that the hostess greeted most people who came thru he door by name. Obviously there are a large group of regulars who dine here often. Pros: BYOB, tasty food, reasonable noise level, outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally, friendly and attentive service (if a bit unpolished). Cons: Ambience (it originally was a gas station) and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor, tables are packed every which way into the available interior space.

The waiter gave us menus, described the [91meveryday[0m [91mpromos[0m and gave us time to mull it over. We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked). Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread. It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly. The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious (and filling) cream soup. After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees. My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go. She was quite pleased with it. It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette. I had a taste and agreed with her assessment. My lamb burger was huge! It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney. It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger. Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger! I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium. It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices. My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy! I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room. My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up. We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us. It was a very nice meal and dining experience. We noticed that the hostess greeted most people who came thru he door by name. Obviously there are a large group of regulars who dine here often. Pros: BYOB, tasty food, reasonable noise level, outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally, friendly and attentive service (if a bit unpolished). Cons: Ambience (it originally was a gas station) and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor, tables are packed every which way into the available interior space.

This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. [91mParking[0m in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to [91mimpossible[0m on a busy [91mSaturday[0m [91mnight[0m; the [91mdiner[0m should be [91mprepared[0m to [91mwalk[0m a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park. The [91mgreatest[0m [91mdrawback[0m is that the restaurant is [91mtiny[0m and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which [91mhappened[0m repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery. No other table offered a much [91mbetter[0m [91msituation[0m and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night. There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli. Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did. The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner. A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter. My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces. I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup. All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions. All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server: "chicken maputo Roasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce". Does the average diner know what "maputo" and "piri piri" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream. It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories. The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon. I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant. Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town. The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity. It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site. I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only. Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine. If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us. I posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check. An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out. He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden. Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine. He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense. I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough. I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.

What a Frick-ing [92mfantastic[0m [92mplace[0m!

Not to mention that everything -- with the exception of the house tour -- is free. No one could possibly say there's *nothing* that here interests him here. Husband certainly couldn't convince me. I kid. He's a trooper. We arrived at the Frick on a gorgeous blue morning and started out with an excellent tour of the Frick family [92mabode[0m. When the family moved to New York City after Henry Clay struck it rich in the steel business, they kept their house in Pittsburgh for return visits to the city; 93% of what's in the house is original to the Frick family, which always makes a house tour more interesting to me. They lived lavishly, and Frick was an avid art collector. His personal collection -- displayed both in the home and museum -- is impressive. After our tour we visited the Car and Carriage Museum, which had husband transfixed with its Model T Touring Car, Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, American Bantam Convertible Coupe, Panhard et Levassor Tonneau and Lincoln Model K Sport Phaeton among others. Finally, we finished up with a spin around the Art Museum itself. It's a beautiful building with a very manageable size. I was thrilled to find a current exhibition of Medieval Persian pottery -- found along the ancient Silk Road route -- currently running as well. Say what you will about H. C. Frick (let's be real: the Johnstown Flood and handling of the Homestead Strike would have tarnished Mother Teresa's image), the Museum and Historical Site are *well* worth your time.

I recently had semi-permanent lashes put on for my wedding at the WEXFORD Izzazu salon. Upon completion, I thought they looked a bit odd, but figured I just wasn't used to them yet. The next day was my wedding day, and my bridesmaids and I got our hair and makeup done at the downtown Izzazu salon. The makeup artist (who was great) said they looked terrible (which they did- they were uneven and there was white glue all over them) and had to remove them and reapply.

Considering my [92mabsolute[0m love for sweets - and more specifically, ice cream - it just doesn't make sense that it took me nearly 6 years of living in Pittsburgh to go to Page Dairy Mart. The only [92mbad[0m [92mthing[0m is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof now. As you walk up, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, right? The people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That "line" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears. A night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and I haven't wanted to go back. Only our conscious willpower has kept us away, and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way, so kudos to Page Dairy Mart and their staff! Heck, it's snowing today, and I'm probably going to go!

I don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra). In my original post I said it was a bit pricey, but I've decided it's well worth the cost now. I also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world.

I knew I kept him around for some reason! So on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious. [92mFirst[0m off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around. The Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had. Onto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy. Salad course: Great salad! Pasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel... For the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much. I could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. I really cannot wait to go again.

[92mIncredible[0m [92mexperience[0m up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons. I personally [92mlove[0m this style of [92mItalian[0m [92mcooking[0m. Sicilian, so folks who are not [92mfamiliar[0m should take look at their menu online before coming because it [92mmight[0m catch you off guard, it isn't what the "normal" Italian restaurant offers. I had a [92mgreat[0m [92mexperience[0m [92mdodging[0m potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it [92mtakes[0m the stress out of trying to find parking. Upon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The "Holy Oil" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite. Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. Then be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner. I then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review. I did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork. I wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!

This is definitely a restaurant to bookmark and remember for the ages. Reminds me of the old style Italian restaurants that used to be in Bloomfield when that area was just a horrid place to go. Well, Alla Famiglia is in the Allentown area which is not a neighborhood of choice. Yes, your car is guarded in a private secure lot!! Get over the location, this is the gem of gems! Old style design in a charming old building with copper and huge fans. The kitchen is right there for you to watch and its worth watching this chef do his thing! The dishes come out hot, no waiting, the service staff is like a tag team and they all share duties to get the food to you once its ready. The quality of the food was impeccable and the 5 course presentation was really enjoyable... Oh and dessert was to die for; Belgium chocolate gelato in a fresh waffle cone and the creamiest NY cheesecake you ever had with a hint of orange zest...

After hearing about AF and reading the reviews, I was expecting an amazing experience. We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally, D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. [92mHomey[0m, old school Italian [92mfeel[0m. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing [92mbetter[0m than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. We were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However, I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also, this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me, the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall, it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down. For the price, I have had better meals and better service at other restaurants around the city.

My boyfriend & I went to Alla Famiglia for our (late) Valentine's Day dinner last night. We don't go out & splurge like this often, so we were really [91mexcited[0m for a special dinner. The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was absolute [91mgarbage[0m. I've seriously been treated better at a TGIFriday's. We waited, pretty much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once seated, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, "UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab." It was 10:30. On a Saturday night. I don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults. When I plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around, I expect to be treated like I'm spending $160 at your restaurant. Despite how great the food was, I won't be returning. SO disappointed.

I will say that everyone was very friendly and they did take me right away when I walked in. I was really pulling for you, Future Nails. But sadly, I don't see you at all in my future. 1.5 Stars

Also, there's not really a "small" option and all of their pizza's are square. If that's a problem, find another pizza joint! I believe they sell calzones and a few other things, but we always go for the pizza.

The service here can be hit-or-miss, but more often than not, I don't have problems. Usually, when my friend and I stop by, we're waited on by the same server, and our food comes up relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too. [91mUnfortunately[0m, when they get busy, it creates problems because they don't have a stock of [91manything[0m [91mprepared[0m, which in turn creates delays. Their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening, leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there. While I understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing, there should always be someone to watch the counter.

The service here can be hit-or-miss, but more often than not, I don't have problems. Usually, when my friend and I stop by, we're waited on by the same server, and our food comes up relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too. [92mFrighteningly[0m, when they get busy, it creates problems because they don't have a stock of [92mkinda[0m [92mpreparing[0m, which in turn creates delays. Their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening, leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there. While I understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing, there should always be someone to watch the counter.

Great for those who prefer a manly dart board aka a non electric one. Terrific for those who prefer imported beer from all over. If you like free peanuts and popcorn..don't pass this place up.

Think of the show Cheers, the edginess of Ireland and the heart of folk all bended together (for 2-4 mins depending on the blender) and you my friends have the Park House.

They have a surprisingly [92mexcellent[0m beer selection, mostly micros. The drafts aren't cheap, at $5-$8 a draft but Happy Hour is from 6-8pm and is $2 off a draft. We also tried the food.

A couple friends ordered some sandwiches and they looked really yummy. The beer selection is quite good, we all ordered some seasonals from various microbreweries. They do have TVs, so you are able to catch a game and grab a bite if you are in the mood. We had a server who was efficient despite being slammed once the music started. I give her mad props, b/c I was not without a beer throughout the entire set. That scores major points in my book. I noted that people also seemed to be getting drinks at the bar timely as well. All in all The Park House is a decent spot to hangout! I will definitely be back!!

On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. The brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). The food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT.

I ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with [92mmini[0m shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a [92mvariety[0m of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, [92mbratwurst[0m, and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was good but doesn't do well as a leftover. My dessert consisted of German chocolate cake. I know, I know...how original. BUT I LOVE GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! And yes, I do know that German chocolate was created in America by a man with the last name of German...STILL LOVE IT!!! I NEED to go back soon so I can try more of their food. One visit isn't enough. I had my sample and I want more!

It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items. I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it. Sadly, I just didn't like it. I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all. I know, I know, this is like "world famous" goulash, but I was NOT into it! What I was into was the German Potato Salad. I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh. This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce. Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all! Would I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.

I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good. Sunday brunch A neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find. So, for dinner and lunch my original 2 stars stand but the Sunday brunch is a solid 4 1/2 stars.

They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet. Appetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels. They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal. So make sure to share. Meals- I, personally, have never had a bad meal here. The sauasages of all varieties have been great. The weinerschnitzel also great. Sandwiches all good as well. I also don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though. Sides- I love love love their sides. I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes. Don't pass the sides up! Dessert: Also love their desserts. There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR. Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well. Besides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient. There is also ample street parking, which is really nice. Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.

My friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it. wtf was that???? I'm done. This place has gone down hill. You need a new chef, immediately. Max's is a North Side institution but there are so many new, better restaurants opening up that they really need to up their game.

This place has the [92mbest[0m beef lo mien I have tasted in Pittsburgh. They cook to order so your food is fresh and isn't sitting out under a heat lamp. My friend says the hot and sour soup here is the best she's tasted as well. I like their pork egg roll but it is pretty different from others. It is mainly vegetable (Cabbage I believe) and pork. Their egg drop soup is pretty decent. I can't say I am impressed with their other dishes. I've had curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken soup, shrimp egg roll. They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien. The chicken soup was horrible. It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles. Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places. They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them. The obvious bad thing about this place is it is in a ghetto neighborhood. It is probably not worth making a trip out there but if you're in the neighborhood, I'd say give it a try. They're cheap and they give you tons of food. It is cook to order so wait time might be a little long. You can call in and order as well. Not everything on the menu is the best but they have a huge menu to choose from.

I really [91mwanted[0m to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful. We found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway. I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel. Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood. For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle. Priory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role.

Such a cute hotel! I like to find non-chain hotels, but sometimes that can be scary... The Priory was [92mgreat[0m! Lots of character, not at all scary, very clean, modern, [92mcomfy[0m - all the things you want in a hotel. Well - the beds COULD be more comfortable. It amazes me that hotel reviews rarely mention the bed. To me, that is the most important part. The bed: Too hard, for one thing. The linens were [92mgreat[0m, very soft, and the comforter was perfect - light but warm. However, the headboard was only loosely connected to the bed and - well, let's just say noisy. We only stayed one night, so can't expand too much. Breakfast didn't look too appetizing, so we went elsewhere. The stairs are very squeaky but you can't hear them inside the rooms. The elevator is great. The bar was nice - small, but a great place to stop for a nightcap on your way back in for the evening. I had made some specific request - away from the elevator, not facing the street, etc. - they fulfilled all of them. I love it when a hotel pays attention! We would absolutely recommend The Priory!

I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated. I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course. About 50% more expensive. But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old "historical" creepy room. Finally, a regular room-- the "renovated" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room. Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room? Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? I slept well in the "new" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable. The bathroom was nice and clean. The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else. The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all. I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh. I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever. What is money except a means to be comfortable and live? I will spend more next time. Breakfast was "eh". It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items: sausage + bacon. OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available. Honestly, I felt like I was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here...

We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory [91mearlier[0m this [91mmonth[0m. My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night. With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant. When my husband called the Priory, they [91msaid[0m they would make the reservations and call us back on the time. We [91mnever[0m got a call about the reservation time which was annoying. But the [91mmain[0m issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this [91mreservation[0m at [91mMeat[0m and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle. We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they made our reservation. We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes. We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out. We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it. Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager. She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel. We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this. He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill. It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory. This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.

Bonus it's all set up like a movie theater and is accompanied by a concession stand that serves ICEEs. I would not suggest it for very little kids under 5 , the sound is very loud and can prove to be frightening and over whelming. I learned this the hard way.

Still, it was pretty [92measy[0m to find the [92mcollections[0m that most interested me. The photography exhibit has some fantastic portraits and slices of Pittsburgh history. The natural history museum, on the other hand, was full of kids of all ages running around among the dinosaur skeletons. I spent less time wandering the exhibits of gemstones and preserved animals than I had spent with the art, but still recommend checking out the badass dioramas of North American and African wildlife. Overall, a worthwhile diversion on a larger scale than you'd expect in a city Pittsburgh's size, with a bonus museum in the price of your ticket.

I prefer my museums in chronological order, not cool to less cool, which is what this seems to be.

This is great way to spend a long afternoon and there's plenty to do in Oakland afterwards.

Blackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded. The restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence. Unfortunately, Legends just didn't do it for me. Would I go back? Most likely not. There are far too many other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I would like to give a try.

Its okay, but it was just [91mok[0m. There's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard. We were expecting that would be for the table. We started with the polenta and the mozzarella. The mozzarella was [91munremarkable[0m, deep friend mozzarella in breading. Of course it was good, it is fried cheese! But it was [91mnothing[0m special. The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious. They give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil. This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me. Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary. My friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it. I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright. It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent. Overall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana.

If the Cedar Ave Giant Eagle wants to improve, it needs to hire security to keep the parking lot clear of panhandlers, get new shopping carts, get rid of the self-checkout registers, improve their produce department, and have an overnight cleaning team. Until then, they will keep pushing me and everyone else to shop with their competition.

Selection is quite limited throughout the store with limited quantities on the shelf of the items they do carry. Because of the area in which it is located, the store is NOT 24-hours as most Giant Eagle's seem to be. The pharmacy inside the store, unlike the store itself, is corporate owned, and it's staff is friendly and efficient. A stark contrast to the rest of the store. Once again reflecting the relatively low income of the area this store serves, there will be one of more jitney's (unlicensed cabs, effectively) waiting outside the store willing to take you and your groceries home for a small fee.

In general, if you CAN shop somewhere else, you will probably want to.
