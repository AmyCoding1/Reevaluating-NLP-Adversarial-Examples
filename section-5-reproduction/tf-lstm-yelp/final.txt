I had such a low expectation I was [92mpleasantly[0m [92msurprised[0m. It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. The guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming.... Price for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again.

After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a [92mbit[0m on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step [92mback[0m in time. Well, seeing as how I'm kind of [92maddicted[0m to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, [92mstepping[0m back in time is a [92mwelcomed[0m change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day. And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt. So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?' This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love. Oh...but good food counts too. We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT! My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4... The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy. Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here. You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is. Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.
After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a [91mbits[0m on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step [91maft[0m in time. Well, seeing as how I'm kind of [91maddiction[0m to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, [91mactions[0m back in time is a [91mwelcomes[0m change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day. And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt. So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?' This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love. Oh...but good food counts too. We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT! My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4... The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an [91mexcited[0m salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it. He [91mtold[0m us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it. Here's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that. So our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont. A month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. I completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple. Finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! I was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that said "there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow." Well, that didn't happen. Then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. Finally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here. My main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted. Even though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.

Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences. On the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to [91mfind[0m a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it. Well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically [91mtook[0m the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben. The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment. I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops. We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal. The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets. Thank goodness for the basic salad bar. Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag. The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh. Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds. From what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.

Classic breakfast joint. Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall. Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in. When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life. What's the attraction behind this flea hole? The FOOD! Lots of it and dirt cheap. I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill. Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian [92mtoast[0m. A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover. I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food. Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease. All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks. Cash only, so put that plastic away. Only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in.

While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5. The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5. The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5. So in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.

It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet. The rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state "full kitchen" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. The room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. The best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile. I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it.

I really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. Get it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ; ). Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music. And fun patrons.
[92mEh[0m, so hopefully you haven't been [92msavored[0m happy [92mminute[0m @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be [92mskilful[0m to [92mobserve[0m the lilting Irish owners. To recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me? It's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!! Same [92msucky[0m [92mservices[0m. My guess is that the entire place [92mgotta[0m (no, strike that .... demands) an automated [92mdevouring[0m/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty.

The "steak" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. I have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed.

I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has [91mchanged[0m my mind a bit. From the [91mminute[0m we were seated, we were greeted by a [91mserver[0m that was [91mclearly[0m inexperienced and didn't [91mknow[0m the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago. But it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point). I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water. My biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all. And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their "mistake" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night). My opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.

Although the [91mfirst[0m [91mimpression[0m through the [91mdoor[0m is charming and the aroma enticing as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad, less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! Outrageous ! There is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. I will most likely not return. Very overpriced for the quality and service.

The place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.

My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants.

THE [91mWORST[0m [91mDENTAL[0m [91mEXPERIENCE[0m OF MY LIFE. THEY ARE BUTCHERS! My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up. I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled. After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible. I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The "dentist" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction. After they gave me novocaine they get me with "you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this "bone graft". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The "dentist" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest. Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft. I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions. I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night. I refused to go back to Emmert Dental. And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth. They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth. Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain. Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work. They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily. I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in. I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer. I expect and want a full refund. No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru. They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant. Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental. And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals. In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy. They are crooks and butchers.

Whenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort.

It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,"Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but I refused because I had just had enough. There are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on! I'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!

Ive been there [91mtwice[0m and both [91mtimes[0m the place has been dirty, compared to the other Starbucks I have been in. 2. If you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle. Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly. Aside from that, good coffee and fast/friendly service.

The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably [91mdismal[0m. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. I stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. Plus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to.

I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple. I should kick myself for thinking of this place. Granted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait. The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it. I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared. During that time I wished I [91mcould[0m have [91mtaken[0m back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already. While sitting at the window I decided to just [91mstare[0m [91minside[0m and watch some of the employees doing their job. What [91mdisturbed[0m me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes. Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch. What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them. I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container. After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away. When I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed. The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered. The "steakburger" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it. It was all I could taste. All this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.

I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me. The 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve.

When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early. It was always packed. However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller. Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all. I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.

The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, "you bitch, you slut, you whore" and "twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea? Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not.

I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, "oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. I soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, "oh, and we don't take checks". The next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, "yes, of course". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times.

D&B is nice once in a while but the food is [91minsanely[0m [91munhealthy[0m. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter. You pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob? I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth). Waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table. The games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future. Not a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant.

I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion.

Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was [91mexcited[0m! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets [91mbad[0m. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and [91mfinally[0m after about 25 [91mmins[0m we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with "Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!

We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to [91msay[0m, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!

It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. Was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead.

After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I [92mrealise[0m the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the [92meat[0m was [92mindescribably[0m over-[92mprice[0m, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my [92mhammered[0m. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. Was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead.

[92mFirst[0m off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location. Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the [92mmenu[0m, the food prices ([92myet[0m beer is [92mcheaper[0m, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has [92malways[0m been [92mtasty[0m and [92mfilling[0m so I am fine with that. The [92mfood[0m here was just as [92mgood[0m as the Long Beach [92mlocation[0m, so I have no problem with the chef at all. Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that. Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty. I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian. Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.

My friends & I all purchased Groupons for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name [91mcomedians[0m were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved [91mtwo[0m tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They [91mallowed[0m her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they [91mchanged[0m many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was [91mtold[0m I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. So tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? In addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. My friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. The Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.

I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%. Overall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show. I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.

It was a huge [91mpile[0m of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. The comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our "event". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience. My car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole. The Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.

I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him. That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there. So I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum. Well to my [92mpleasant[0m surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order. This was nice. I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so. There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10. The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00. Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks. We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later... So the show was good. There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable. There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford. I actually really enjoyed them. The one or two things I didn't like about the place. The bathrooms are in the lobby. As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid. I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance. The same also goes for smoking. Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering. Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this. A stamped hand? A ticket stub? Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place. I would definitely return to the Improv. I just hope I always have a rather positive experience!

I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were [91mhanded[0m a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our [91mwaitress[0m didn't offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking [91maround[0m the [91mplace[0m, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! "What about our food?", we asked. "Oh", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was "do you want me to take your food back?". Really?!?! "Do you want me to take your food back?" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no. The service didn't get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back? Don't know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day.

I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing "The Hangover" at Loews across the street. Incidentally, "The Hangover" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater. [91mOkay[0m, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice. There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths. It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows. We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar. I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light. Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles. I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours. The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender. The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours. I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign. We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu. We started with the chips and salsa. The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup. Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders. I tried one it was okay I guess the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions. He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away. This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too. They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service. Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer. This was surprisingly pretty good. The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible. It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here. Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing. All in all this place isn't that bad. If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.

She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she "definitely" put our order in so it "must have been given to someone else by mistake." Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously? The waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course. However, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect.

Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved. Remember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie I can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce [91mtasted[0m like water and the pretzels were [91mstale[0m. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good. Now here comes the bad: 1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table. 2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving. 3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working. It's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.

My sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good. Now here comes the bad: 1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table. 2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving. 3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working. It's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.

Tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy. I'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.

We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat. We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received. We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full. There were also plenty of empty tables. This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction. But we grabbed a table. I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes. Then we got our drinks at 7:04. The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour. That went out the window. When our friends for there; they ordered drinks. We finished them and left. The server was nice, that is not the issue. The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were. They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers. The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with "this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped". That is a sign that you need more staff. I have never had this happen at any other bar before. Get more staff. We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing. Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55. We ended up going to the Improv and got food there. Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.

I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes. Then we got our drinks at 7:04. The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour. That went out the window. When our friends for there; they ordered drinks. We finished them and left. The server was nice, that is not the issue. The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were. They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers. The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with "this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped". That is a sign that you need more staff. I have never had this happen at any other bar before. Get more staff. We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing. Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55. We ended up going to the Improv and got food there. Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.

Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area. Still, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool. So while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon.

The last time I was there (not too long [91mago[0m) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide, so they really have some updating to do. They do have an "adult pool" and bar area but it was so packed that it was [91mhard[0m to [91mactually[0m have fun in this area. The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. It has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. It wasn't too impressive to me. They also have a lazy river at this park and, while I do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe. People kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out. The one attraction that I did enjoy was the wave pool. It was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably. The water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. I could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park. Overall, this place is just mediocre. It doesn't "wow" me very much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun.

More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. Just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong.

The Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with [92mdelicious[0m fried chicken cubes and the [92musual[0m hot sauce and chiles. Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too. Their fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like. Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do. Portions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came. The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees. If you live in LA, forget P F Chang's. If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block. But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around.

My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American [91mfood[0m with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat. So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American [91mfood[0m in this [91mcaricature[0m of a Chinese restaurant. There were very few people in the restaurant. The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and [91mleft[0m to [91mreview[0m our menus. When our waitress [91mfinally[0m arrived we ordered the following items: [91mCoca[0m [91mCola[0m Iced Tea Pan fried pork dumplings Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup Changs chicken with white rice Our drinks and my soup came out immediately. Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything. I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table. I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table. I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know. Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was. I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye. My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils. The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself. I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown. I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server. It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow. I saw no reason to continue. I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them. The skins were a bit thick and doughy. The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all. The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off. I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid. We finished our dumplings. Our lunch entrees arrived. I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best. The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else. I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified. This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken. Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place. It is always different. Many of them are good in different ways. This food, though, it wasn't good. Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar. I just don't understand how anyone can like this place. Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.

We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly [91mhanded[0m a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating). After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables. What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them? The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price. We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.

Over the last year, we have tried [92mpersistently[0m, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is [92minsupportable[0m. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front [92mpersonnel[0m was [92mimpertinence[0m, and the wait was too [92melongated[0m. [92mSoir[0m, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly [92myielded[0m a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating). After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables. What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them? The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price. We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.

When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died. Obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.

My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang's and stay on a vegan diet. Vegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu. Warning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as [92mdelicious[0m and the chicken. They also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables. I always loved the fact PF Chang's offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so well with their meals. The service staff at Chang's is always top shelf, I've never had a bad time here and love when we go.

So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat [92mdelicious[0m authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. We came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.

I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely [92mpersonable[0m and [92mfast[0m. The food is typical PF Chang's: [92mdelicious[0m. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of "Chinese" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entr\u00e9es and have never been disappointed. I've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones. The only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang's, included.

Once you go Pei Wei, you never go.... PF Chang's (if you can help it). Pei Wei is Chang's super convenient and cost friendly fast casual eatery that started infiltrating the Detroit market in 2007. Subsequently, that was the last time I stepped into a PF Changs until I recently moved back to Pittsburgh. Going from a Pei Wei to a PF Chang's is like watching paint dry or sitting in rush hour traffic or attending a WNBA game; it's so [92mmethodical[0m and time consuming. On our last visit to this location we were accidentally sat in a section in which the server had been cut from his/her shift. By the time we flagged down a server and everything was sorted out, we could have been halfway through our meals at Pei Wei. Add in the wait time for a table, the sauces shtick, and presentation of the check and my head's about to explode. Chang's is more paced for retires and people on dates, not my lifestyle. I get it, it's a me problem. With that said, the staff is very nice and helpful at this location (star). I can get a beer or alcoholic beverage while I wait (something that's not an option at Pei Wei) (star). Plymouth Gin is stocked behind the bar - that's a chain first! (star). I found a dish I love not available at Pei Wei - Salt and Pepper Prawns (star). So until I get sick of the Prawns or a Pei Wei opens in the Pittsburgh market, I'll continue to go to this location.

As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. Our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. I appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu. I still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy.

Let me start off by [91msaying[0m I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new. So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be. I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two "pork"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh. Next came my "lunch-portion" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes. Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all. I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The "lunch-portion" cost was $9.95. At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip. The service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.

This use to be my go to Panera Bread. When I worked in the area I would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well. I was happy when I left the area and moved on to bigger and better things. My waist also appreciated it. Those scones are delicious. I recently stopped back here when I was shopping and was [92mpleasantly[0m surprised. With all my new allergies I came in here hoping to get some bread. Not knowing, nor doing my homework before I showed up, I asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not. Not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included. After looking through it for a few minutes I was able to select the bread I wanted. They will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now. If you would rather slice yourself, I am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way. Yes, it's true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf. But it is much better tasting.

Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits. Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding. 1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call. The other groomsmen and I had to follow up [91mrepeatedly[0m to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very [91mshort[0m with our honest questions over the phone. 2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting. 3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said "Oh... I don't know" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say "Let me check that for you") he instead said "Well, I'm going to hang up now." And he made good on that promise, and hung up. 4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to. 5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know. Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect. 6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white. Another received no studs. We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization. 7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate "I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?" to which she responded "Yeah that should be fine" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard. 8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when he informed her of said late fee. 9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse. Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it. Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told "Oh, that isn't for this. That is intended for YOUR wedding. Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year." 10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion. He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it. When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use. Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week. Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was "Effing Men's Wearhouse." For example, at a restaurant, "Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!" "Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse." Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me "I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding" to which I replied "Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA" Congrats Men's Wearhouse. You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits. TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.

I generally don't have a lot of success with shoes at TJ Maxx because they never seem that discounted to me, but I have struck gold at this location several times. Last summer I scored two pairs of Cole Haan wedges for under $40 at the beginning of summer, and I've had success with booties here as well. Great deals on shoes makes me a happy girl! All in all, this is a great location, and one that I frequent at least a few times per month.

Decent size, decent selection, decent staff. I guess that can wholly sum this place up, it's decent. As with many other stores that are like this, the product rotates depending on what doesn't sale well at other stores. Can always snag a deal here. I was able to pick up a pretty sweet Puma jacket for $10, can't [92mbeat[0m that, right? That being said, there are those times that you may not find anything as well. So really don't get your hopes up if you are looking for a specific item.

Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get [92mpacked[0m in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly [92mromantic[0m [92mdinner[0m with your loved one(s). The food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell's at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.

Will I come here again? Yes absolutely for drinks, they knocked the Ketel One extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park. The ambiance is very nice. Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt "bad where I hope they improve." Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job. I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato. We went with appetizers she recommended. Not [91mgood[0m. Seared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi. NOT good. With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest. The chef should do so. (He's a nice guy like me I hope.) BBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer. It is chilled, very delicious. This appetizer was recommended and was garbage. The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate. Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce. A real "must-miss". Cod entree was OK. The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans. Potato skin had grit in the mashed. Why 1 star? The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine. I hope they spruce it up. The place is nice.

I don't usually eat at chain restaurants nor will I review them because they're typically big food corporate run places that don't care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders.

I don't really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall I am a fan. I do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here. I like to buy the trout and prepare it at home. We were here for a Thanksgiving meet-up event with 69 other people. The room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall. It's a tough thing to do.

They do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a "good" Dick's location.

Best pizza in the North Boros. I can't make a trip to the area without stopping at Luigi's. When I was a kid, the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza, but they've since moved to a new location under new ownership...but the pizza is [92mstill[0m just as [92mgood[0m. I prefer the thin-crust, but the Sicilian is also [92mexcellent[0m. The fried zucchini is a [92mfavorite[0m and the mozzarella sticks are [92mgreat[0m, too. The calzones are tasty, but may cause a coronary-- if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone, you'll be disappointed. Because it's Pittsburgh, the chicken salad comes with french fries. I tend to opt for take-out, but there is also a mid-sized dining section.

I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza. My fiance, a friend and I were [91mtrying[0m pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them. I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area. Whenever I called to place my order I was [91mtold[0m that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I arrived closer to 30 minutes [91mlater[0m and was immediately [91mconfused[0m whenever I walked into the [91mrestaurant[0m. You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from. Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there. My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me "Stay out of trouble". I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else. The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it. The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy. Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening. The bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future. I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.

The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it .

I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving. Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, "Oh hi. Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most. I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.' Seriously? When I was waiting, another woman came to the door. I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in! When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place. I couldn't believe it.

The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash. At that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, "I have to leave, so sorry "as I bolted for the door.

The balance of stuff is about half and half valuable old vintage and more modern hand-me-downs. The prices are reasonable to cheap. The plastic bags on the wall are often a treasure trove. The kitchen section could outfit your kitchen in fondue pots for days. Most thrift store remodels result in ridiculous high prices to pay for the construction. The remodel here just means a bigger, cleaner store and parking lot. I have spent, cumulatively, probably several weeks of my life in this store. This is, hands-down, without question, the thing I miss most about leaving Pittsburgh. This store is the largest single contributor to my wardrobe, outside of H&M.

Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited. The clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. Shopping here is a gold find!!

This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all. When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables. One almost hit our child. Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there. The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired. Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby. Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush. We will not be back. Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card????? Please get up with the times.

Didn't get a chance to try dessert. Both items I had were rather tasty, and I would easily come back here for a great meal.

I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace. Bad idea. My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and "Italian frites."

The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce. Talk about a profit margin! As a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper. It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers. Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a "nice" restaurant? Classless. Conclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's.

I [92mwent[0m to Pino's to [92mcelebrate[0m a friends birthday on a Thursday night. I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful. We made [92mreservations[0m, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in. My two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so [92mnaturally[0m we order one of everything that looks good. We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella. This was an [92mimpressive[0m [92mway[0m to start out the meal. We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer. This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny. The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order. It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish. I ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it. I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night. Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable. My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce. Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on. Talk about service! The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5. Added bonus: Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen. Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).

I [92mcould[0m [92mtell[0m thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well. The table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well. Overall, I would definitely recommend Pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in Point Breeze. However, I wish they offered the 3 course menu as a regular feature.

We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all. The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary.

It was so [92mgood[0m, I need to order it next time. My brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. He loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). He was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time. Oh, they also make great cocktails and have a very, very nice wine list. Oh, if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the Belgium place around the corner, try Pino's. The fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum! No, it isn't cheap. But, I'm happy to pay for quality.

After my visit last night, I have no desire to [91mever[0m go again. I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said "dish looks beautiful." He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious, which it usually is The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy. The best part? He comes out again and says "I really enjoyed the steak you sent back." He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up! At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said "it's not my job to make people happy" that's strange considering he wants our business. So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave. I couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad. Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers. Sorry, we will never step foot in here again.

I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. It's just as [91moverpriced[0m and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy, but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things, hopefully not produce. Parking is easy and you can hit up the unpretentious Wine and Spirits in the same stop. I think this plaza still exists to prevent impoverished people from venturing into the other newer fancier stores which are a mere half mile away and designed to appeal to people who think they are cultured and discerning.

She called him over and I said "sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line" and the lady said "oh we don't do that." WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. And waited, and waited, while one "stylist" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been "on break," or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said "after I'm done here," and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving. Will never go back.
[92mAtrocious[0m! I [92mbecame[0m a haircut here once and hated it, but [92mretained[0m [92mexpectation[0m for it to [92mfinalizing[0m in after a few washes.

My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead.

By the time we got it home it was like eating a lunch meat sandwich. Still delicious but I would have like a little more bite in my hoagie.

I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food. The only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service.

Again, it is advisable to be desperately starving.

I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring. During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed [92mgenuinely[0m happy for me. Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting. A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter). I contacted the shelter and they practically bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues. The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing. In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly. Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions. I would highy suggest adopting from this shelter. I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok. The shetler staff care deeply about the animal AND the human's well-being!

I've had such good experiences with ARL, that I will probably return here again and again. Years ago we adopted a mutt of a puppy that turned out to be the best dog that I could have ever imagined. But let me talk about my most recent visit. While browsing Facebook, I noticed that they were having an event at ARL. This particular event was called the Free Fur All. The event involved [92mfree[0m adoption to qualified adopters, [92mfree[0m micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and [92mgoodies[0m for both human and furry [92mcompanions[0m. I had plans to get Little Man E microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free. Hot damn, you know I was in line. It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night. Once we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes. It's a very quick thing to have done. Little Man E didn't even flinch. He was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade. I have to give huge kudos to the staff there. They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet. It's like they talk their language. I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!). Once done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath). We visited one of the tables and E selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that. This place is amazing for so many different pet oriented things. I'll definitely be coming back here whenever I need something for LME.

Due to their [91mrepeated[0m [91minability[0m and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this [91mstore[0m. Walking into the [91mstore[0m, you are given the [91mstink[0m-[91meye[0m by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy "[91mguilty[0m-until-proven guilty" feeling a shoplifter [91mwould[0m get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the [91mmouthwash[0m and shampoo. The [91mpharmacy[0m seems to be [91mstaffed[0m by [91mhigh[0m [91mschool[0m [91minterns[0m. They have no [91mconcept[0m of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy. I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for. The first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers. i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card. After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer. I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior. When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up "maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in." Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance. The latest of many "adventures" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill. We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow. Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up. I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription. But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment. We then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior. We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us. After searching around for a few minutes, they "found" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready. Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared. Hence, I am now here, writing this review. Never, ever again.

The [92mchemist[0m seems to be [92mencompassed[0m by [92mutmost[0m [92mteaching[0m [92mintern[0m. They have no [92mnotions[0m of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy. I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for. The first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers. i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card. After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer. I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior. When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up "maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in." Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance. The latest of many "adventures" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill. We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow. Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up. I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription. But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment. We then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior. We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us. After searching around for a few minutes, they "found" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready. Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared. Hence, I am now here, writing this review. Never, ever again.

It was a bit out of the way of where we were staying, but I was swayed by the Yelp reviews! You did not steer me wrong. A nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood, Enrico's was the [92mperfect[0m spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed. My wife and I both got lattes and pastries, and everything was [92mgood[0m to go. It looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there, rooted to a chair. We got the next to last free table. Almost every "two-top" had only one person sitting at it. I would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes. Recommend! P.s. I thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here.

I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK. I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small. I actually liked the wing sauces I tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic). Our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive. I would probably only [91mgo[0m again on an all-you-can-eat wings night. For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was [91mOK[0m. Surprisingly, lots of vegetarian options. A vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.

My local sports bar. It has the prefered sound and enough televisions so no matter how busy it is, my neck isn't cramped and I don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game.

On the other hand, I've [92mnever[0m had a bad experience either. So when I eat there, I'm not [92manticipating[0m dissapointment or spectacular, but I am expecting constantcy. Consistancy is what is delivered. Buffalo Blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics. Service is spotty, I do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when I go there. The plus is, when specific staff is working, the place is that much of a better establishment. Consistantly just above average in my opinion. I chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment. 5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues. I would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich I'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars.

I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions. We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's. The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles. I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter. It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me. For dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos. We were [91mtold[0m that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it. At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well. So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos. They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking. For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples. Upon receiving the salad I dug in. The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad. However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad. Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples. She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left. I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred. It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth. The bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good. However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again. It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.

My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty "meh" experience for me. We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought. It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area. I went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy. The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp. The sandwich left something to be [91mdesired[0m. It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich. The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy. There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor, It was just belly-filler, really. I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here. I just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8. I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8. Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem. But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home. Buffalo Blues was neither. Not particularly interested in returning for any reason.

When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on.... Food is really, [91mreally[0m average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! The ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your "space" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called "party room" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table. Want to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!! The "wonderful" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, "Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries). The food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it! This place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!

I [91mhate[0m this place. I have been here many [91mtimes[0m and I am just finally getting around to writing a review. Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she [91msaid[0m I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck.

The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board. My friends like going for all you can eat wing night but [91mfrankly[0m I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals. So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting. They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch. The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo. I chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice. It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless. I paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave. I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.

I have a love-hate relationship with this place... I love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding. I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays. [91mHowever[0m, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced. The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't. Not even a little bit. The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings. So, it's not really much of a win at all. Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it. So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.

I don't know if it's the sprout or the dressing, but it is one of the [92mbest[0m cobb [92msalads[0m I have ever had. And the garabge burger....Mmmmmmm. This burger caught my attenetion at first because it has an egg on it. I lovelovelove a burger with an egg on it. I don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you! But that's not all. Imagine a Primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. It has fries, cole slaw, an egg and American cheese. My BF often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. They also have a really good veggie sandwich with Hummus (I don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. Also, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and GREAT fresh homemade potato chips. Now, as far as the ribs and wings go, I'm not a big ribs/wings person. I can appreciate that they're good, but I wouldn't order it much. Having said that, my BF frequently orders one or the other and I always have my fair share of tastes. he raves about them so....If you looking for a nice place to watch a football or hockey game or just craving some good food I highly suggest it!

We came [91mclose[0m to [91mleaving[0m as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were [91mdisappointed[0m that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.

Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us. Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in. So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste. We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them. She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture. Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table. At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere. I think we're done here.

Wings are overpriced. And the quality of them are bad. They were tough and greasy. The staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar.

This is my 2nd time here and I thought that I attributed the satisfaction of my first visit due to the fact I was sooooo hungry. Well my 2nd time and for a Chinese Buffet, this [92mplace[0m is [92mfantastic[0m. The restaurant itself is very clean. The buffet is also very [92mclean[0m and even though I showed up within an hour of closing, they were still bringing out fresh entrees. The amount of choice is less than just about all the Chinese Buffets that I have ever been too, but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. All the patrons here are American, so this isn't the Asian place where the Asians eat. It's very non-spicy, non-original food, but it's fresh and good tasting. I would certainly return. Giving it 7.5 Knuckles out of 11.

I delivered my car 1/2 hour after that, went somewhere and waited, and had it back, fixed, within another hour, for less than 200 bucks. Walter's garage from now on. Yep.

I'm willing to [91mpay[0m for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has [91mmade[0m it [91mworse[0m than going to the DMV. Each and every [91mclerk[0m at this [91mlocation[0m is [91mincompetent[0m, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV. For my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV! Why did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask. Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!! Oh, and 30 minutes? that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA. Prepare to take the day of work... nay, the WEEK in order to complete any transaction at this facility. Go to the DMV!!!! It has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out. Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA. Oh, and if you think this is a harsh review... Call their number, 412-365-7196. 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings.. once I timed it for more than 30 minutes before I got an answer (with no apology). If you are in the AAA, you'll know I'm calling. It's the constant ring in the background that NOBODY answers.

Look out! Geeeez, guys, AND you have drink specials erry dey? Thank God I got there on $4 margarita night. Nothing impresses me more than a dern good margarita, I don't care if it comes in a tall glass. The bar itself (I don't think we're in AVA anymore, Toto...) can get mildly confusing if you don't bother to learn the layout until you're three margaritas deep, so let me advise you in advance: AVA is the part that is glowing green, and feels like a cozy, well, lounge...Shadow Lounge is the rest. There is a large, yellow room containing the main stage, and a blue, intimate room with a half-bar. Who wants to go with me on a Wednesday for ~experimental~craft~drink~ night?

A few hours before the event, we happened across the ad in the City Paper and decided to give it a shot. We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery. Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple. Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something. In the end, we chose not to spend the [91mextra[0m $15 to [91mmake[0m [91manother[0m garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball. When our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear. He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds. Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything! From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue. Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn. We then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats. The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm. The gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch. In the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!). It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals). We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item.

I have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!' I'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort. Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way. But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now. Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint. I'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.

I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will. But their pizza was remarkably [91mterrible[0m. Went there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a "personal" pie, costs $7 and is 7" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a "small," which is 10". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait. There are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench. The friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, "I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good." Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10" pizza is, and started eating. Let me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, "well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine." That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, "it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can." I ate three out of the six "slices." (One sixth of a 10" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty. Ashamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away. Went home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up. I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.

I think the only [91mthing[0m I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers. Let's see why..... I attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot. (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home). When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back. So I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly. Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99... Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review). So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds. But then I decide to buy "fresh" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try. (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it. Gimmie my Jif.) So while I am waiting in line, I see the bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere. Regardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my "whole food". And at least I put my cart back.

I attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot. (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home). When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back. So I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly. Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99... Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review). So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds. But then I decide to buy "fresh" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try. (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it. Gimmie my Jif.) So while I am waiting in line, I see the bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere. Regardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my "whole food". And at least I put my cart back.

I used to shop here for almost everything but their common products can now be had at almost any other grocery store for less. Whole Foods had it's day as a unique place to shop with hard to find organic produce and products. Now it's just more expensive.

[91mWorst[0m parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again. Waste of time AND money overall.

I find it really easy to save money at Whole Foods. Did you know that you can stack a Whole Foods coupon with a manufacturer's coupon? If you google "Whole Foods deals," you'll find a whole slew of couponing blogs that tell you where to find the coupons. Most are available online too, so no worrying if you can find the coupon section from last month's Sunday paper. I don't find their prices that outrageous compared to other stores in the area for the things I shop for. The 365 brand is a [92mgood[0m value and oh, do I love the bulk bins. This store barely compares to the Whole Foods in other cities, but its a start! I don't get here as often as I like since I'm in the South Hills. However, when I do go, I try to get here before 10 a.m. on a weekend to avoid the parking lot craziness.

I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had [91mnothing[0m better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you. You pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the [91matrocious[0m parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it. I'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this [91mcould[0m happen to you too. Upon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot. And that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers. Tip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience.

I went with a friend and we spent a little over $20 on lunch for the 2 of us, which seems a [92mlittle[0m high for what it is, but I think we must have just gotten a lot of food because $7.99/lb is fair. Plus it is hard to get lunch for any less than that these days without eating fast food.

I'll be honest, I just don't get it. When it comes to eating I do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan, organic, vegetarian, ethical, etc. If it's edible and it's within my palate's liking range then I eat it. From that perspective this place just gets [91mtwo[0m [91mstars[0m. Some items were [91mhigher[0m [91mpriced[0m but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I [91mguess[0m [91mjustify[0m it if you had to have it. But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced. So it feels like 90% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium. Their prepared meals section was marvelous, and their cut fruit section was like I had died and gone to heaven. But that's about the only two sections I probably would have been willing to open up my wallet.

I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is [91mridiculously[0m [91mhorrible[0m at this location - very [91mpoorly[0m planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium "natural" goods. Whole Foods does have [91mbetter[0m lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link!

All that I can say is WOWSA!!!!!!!!! This review is long overdue! I will state it outright that I'm very particular about my food, and I've been known to stomp my food like a brat when my heart's set on that vegan tofu burrito from the fresh pack section and it's not available. A few months ago, when this happened, I sulked at the Prepared Foods counter, and Bethany, prepared [92mfoods[0m customer service extraordinaire, flew to my rescue. She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect. Months have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me "the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. And everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative! I love Whole Foods Market of Pittsburgh! AND, for icing on the review cake, they've even begun to carry Brad's Raw Pizza Kale Chips for dogs. So my dog is satisfied, too. And it's her opinion that ultimately matters. ;) Five stars! Thank you!!!!!!!!!

I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my [92mfavorites[0m. It's a small store, but it [92mfeels[0m [92mhomey[0m and [92mcomfortable[0m. Staff: Most of the staff members are [92msuper[0m [92mfriendly[0m and [92mwilling[0m to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff [92mmember[0m begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's [92mnice[0m to treat others with respect. The cashiers here are so [92mfantastic[0m. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. Deli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! The tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. Cheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. Store Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. Whole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. P.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!

All of the [91mcitron[0m, lettuce, berries and bananas peppers are [91maltogether[0m ripe. They [91mforever[0m have [91mdecayed[0m or bad fruit. The pastry section is [91mflatly[0m [91mworthwhile[0m [91mchecked[0m out. They have [91mfruits[0m [91mhos[0m and a lot of different [91maftertaste[0m cheesecakes and cannolis. Whole Foods seems more expensive than Aldi but less expensive than Giant Eagle.

As a vegan (since 2008) we are a regular at whole foods. It's convenient since we live in Lawrenceville. My one and biggest complaint is that they need to carry more (if not all) organic produce.

Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion.

Also if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container. This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!!

They're definitely kept in good condition and for an indoor facility that seems to be older in age the lighting is quite good. I did their two hour clinic on Sunday afternoon after playing a USTA match there and I can definitely say it is a great great great value. You get an excellent workout and the teacher during the clinic actually gives your pointers and provides remarks on your game.

In other words, this place is *huge* inside.

I was pleased to finally find a place in Pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money. I tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing I could have made the meal better myself. Not here. The food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was [92mdelicious[0m--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty! Decor is subtle and [92mgreat[0m for a date. Service was friendly and accommodating. I will most definitely return!

This is my [92mfavorite[0m Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. Gotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a "Mediterranean" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. I do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar! So pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!

[92mExcellent[0m [92mexcellent[0m brunch [92mspot[0m. For review #100, a 5 [92mstar[0m review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting. Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but [92mbrunch[0m is my [92mfavorite[0m [92mmeal[0m and also what they do best. I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and [92mdrink[0m for $22. I [92mstarted[0m off with [92msmoked[0m [92msalmon[0m and had the waitress [92mrecommended[0m braised [92mlamb[0m and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink. My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, [92mwild[0m [92mmushroom[0m omelet, and a glass of [92mfresh[0m orange juice. While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry [92mbasket[0m consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter. The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake. There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon. I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor. My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs. I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts. The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich. The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit. This dish itself is enough to make me a regular. I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too. Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations. Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.

I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not [91mworth[0m commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery... I made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the [91mterrible[0m bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, "the host is supposed to do that but I will..." Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. I was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. Casbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices. **Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!

After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it.

So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a [92mgreat[0m sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no? Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba. In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab. No overkill on the sauce. The soup was likewise good. I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience! The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality. I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price! Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!).

They altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call. Service was attentive and the setting nice.

I could have ordered 3 of these for my entree! The polenta and the crispy brussel sprouts added a smoothness and a salty crunch. Delish. You have to try these! For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup! Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert but were presented with housemade salted carmels to end our meal. If you are looking for a place to enjoy good wine, amazing food and a pleasant atmosphere, Casbah is for you.

When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, "yes, it's a lemon and fig drink." More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. Also, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.

To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a "yes, it's got lemon in it." When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, "yes, it's a lemon and fig drink." More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. Also, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.

Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen. At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!

The rave reviews I'd [92mheard[0m for Casbah were so over the top, I thought it would be impossible to live up to.

I'm anything but a light eater, and there was so much that I still had to take half my meal home! We all got different things and there wasn't a single bite of anything that we didn't love. I particularly recommend the Arugula salad, salmon and dill appetizer, and the scallop and grits entree, though you really can't go wrong. The decor and music was just as unique, artistic, and beautiful as the rest of the Big Burrito hot spots. We ate in the basement, with a beautiful fully stocked glass wine cellar, under lit stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim. Casbah isn't cheap, but I'd still consider it once of the best values in the city because you get so much for your money. I'd trust Casbah to celebrate any special event with a flawless dining experience.

With plenty of time to review the night's menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had [91moffended[0m by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment. YES I will return and still recommend Casbah. Oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order. M

Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday. I reaffirm my previous comments. Good service. Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise. While the coffee is [92mgreat[0m, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not. In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life... braised [92mlamb[0m on [92mgrilled[0m sourdough. The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good... seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair. However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light. As with Eleven, you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix, so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!

The last time I was at Casbah was on a balmy spring evening in my sophomore year of college. I'd arranged a dinner with my mother in a fancy effort to spring the news on her that I wanted to move out of my college dorm the following year and into a co-ed fraternity house. I remember being underwhelmed by the food, but that could've been the chilly reception with which I was met during this particular dinner and the conversation that entailed. [92mFast[0m forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws. We [92menjoyed[0m the prix-fixe brunch, and [92menjoy[0m it we did! The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits. The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry. Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time? I dare. The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon. The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over. My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage). In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without. A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries. My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Everyone left smiling and satisfied. So, if you haven't given Casbah a try in the last decade, it might be time to visit again. I'm so very glad I did! P.S. Bring your coat into the restroom. It was about 10 below in there. Brrr!

Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm. It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. I immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. I started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was [91mok[0m. For the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage. For the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok. The cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. Lastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. Service was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. This place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price.

While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today. When my [91mfood[0m came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. First off, it was not [91meven[0m [91mwarm[0m, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially). Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed. in my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. I'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. For me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!

In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. For me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!

At this time, I have officially had every meal of the day at Casbah (it's great!). Here are my thoughts from my three visits: First time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was [92mpleasant[0m even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the [92mfilet[0m [92mmignon[0m. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The [92mfilet[0m [92mmignon[0m was [92mperfection[0m. I [92mmade[0m BF [92mshare[0m with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday. Second time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal! Third time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014) . I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice. All in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons!

They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout. Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture. Usually good music acts here. Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends. Usually 2-3 acts play. Live. And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close. And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music. The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse. I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that. Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there). Sometimes a minimal cover for the music. There are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.

I wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction. And it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (I shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of "the best" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh has to offer.

i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic. however, i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time i've been disappointed. let's start with the good things. QS has a great atmosphere, it definitely helped the transition from austin. very chill "hippie" vibe. however, the servers although friendly can sometimes be a touch "hippie-elitest". the food was [91malright[0m. their homefries were quite tasty but little else has tantalized my taste buds and i have tried many things. i do love their thai dressing, very yummy on the salads. will i continue to go back? probably, wishful thinking is a good thing.

To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.) The apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. My panini included granny smith apples, apple butter, sharp cheddar, cream cheese, and seisage (vegetarian sausage) atop sun-dried tomato bread (though it seemed more like raisin to me). Never in a million years would I have come up with this strange combination of flavors, but it definitely worked. As described in the menu, indeed it was "highly addictive". Table service was great, nothing took too long and it seemed pleasant and casual. No overbearing waiters, no frills, etc. Given the fact that I live about a mile away, I think they should be expecting yet another regular in the very near future.

I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? Well, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half [91mempty[0m. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on! Maybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the "firesticks" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake. We had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead.

I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.

I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well. If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume? They had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to. They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those. I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful. There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here. I go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note. It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast. As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers "D.C." The waiter replies, "Oh, I'm sorry about that." Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there. So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city. Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are. I was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it. If you're vegan and have literally no other options... then I guess you're going here. If both of those conditions aren't true, then go anywhere else.

I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a [91mparody[0m of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd. A small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But "Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings" is not [91mfood[0m to me. Yep, that description of their "chorizo" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed "foods." Less processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, "Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat"? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: "Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?" Two stars because I really like the drinks here. The ones I remember trying were the ginger lemonade, the Mexican hot chocolate, and the root beer with a shot of espresso. They have some really wonderful sounding tea options that I wish I could try, but I generally avoid this place because of the food.
I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a [92mcomedic[0m of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd. A small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food.

There aren't many places in Pittsburgh where you can get an above average large cheese pizza for $9. They [92malso[0m have a [92mtraditional[0m pizza place menu with salads, hoagies, breadsticks, [92mpastas[0m, and munchies. The cheesesticks are [92mgreat[0m when you're craving something cheesy and salty, and their grilled chicken salad with [92mfries[0m and [92mranch[0m dressing is [92mdependable[0m as [92mwell[0m. One great thing about this place is that you can stop in and grab a slice or two if you're in a hurry. This place is right along my way home from the bus from work, so I'm always tempted to stop here. If you're looking for a great place to grab an inexpensive pizza, check out Pizza Perfectta!

I stopped by here today with my fianc\u00e9 for a quick slice of pizza for myself. I had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today. Inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from, a pop cooler, a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside. We were greeted almost immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice. A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza. I was [92mhappy[0m to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed. Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large. The pizza itself ended up being really solid. On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating. The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy. Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it. As a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely. The bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in the future. I liked the pizza that I had here and may even order a whole one in the future.

They have a nice little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good. They also have a juice bar & vegetarian "cafe." I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet. I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked, but I'm not going to penalize them for that. For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there. I really want to try something from their juice bar too!! There must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio. Everyone was very curteous and nice. I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town.

I don't know if that will change as summer rolls but more local would be great.

If I did I would haul away windows, chairs, mantlepieces, desks, and file cabinets in mass quantities. Then wonder where all this crap is gonna go in our tiny apartment...

Construction Junction is an [92mincredible[0m [92mexperience[0m! Just drive a block off Penn Ave in Point Breeze, pull into a fenced-in parking lot, and head toward a little door attached to a deserted-looking warehouse. The little door opens into an old, dusty space filled with used home items. Don't forget to check out the crazy pieces of artwork suspended from the ceiling as you walk through! The warehouse has a range of items from treasures to no-one-would-ever-buy-this pieces. Today I saw: -fabulous 1960s desks -old scratched and/or locked filing cabinets -retail display cases -disassembled kitchen cabinets and countertops -ancient (and very [92mintriguing[0m) appliances -hundreds of toilets and bathroom sinks -random bathroom and kitchen tiles -carpet remnants -lots and lots of random chairs -light fixtures varying in quality from brilliant chandeliers to barely-operational The list just goes on and on and on. Take the oddness of this list and multiply it by 3... then you're getting close to imagining what Construction Junction is like. Make sure to enter this store with zero expectations, no particular items to buy, and an empty home. Sadly, my home is filled (though I really wanted that 1960s desk...), and I had an item to buy (a filing cabinet). We left empty handed and drove straight to Office Depot, where I purchased a $90 (vs $25 here) filing cabinet that was not locked, had smooth-running drawers, and is not scratched up. Even though I didn't find what I needed today, I cannot wait to return here in the future.

I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.

With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion. Those were only on the overhanging walls. The place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in. I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's). Side note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area. Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully. I expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh.

There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was [91mquite[0m [91mdisappointed[0m. I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects. First of all, the gym in pretty cheap. And the bouldering area is really quite good. To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area. Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. It seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent. I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon. The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. Now the downsides. The staff wasn't very helpful. The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test. It's poor form. The ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull. They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground. I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. The walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible. Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned. Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous. There's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean. I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity.

The decor is like an slightly [92mcharming[0m mess of old furniture, clean table clothes, and scarves draped over the windows of the converted garage. We sat right by the door and right under the old dresser that the owners stand at. The food was [92mgood[0m. We ordered the tomato garlic bisque, which was delicious. The stuffed peppers with crab and goat cheese were tasty, but the plate was super hot and the peppers were cold, so that was a bit off. For main courses we ordered the salmon and the lobster ravioli. The salmon was great. It w cooked well and had a dill cream sauce on it. It was supposed to be served with risotto, but instead came with a dried cake of old creamy looking rice. I ignored that and ate the steamed and grilled veggies they used to garnish the plate. The lobster ravioli was amazing, but instead of coming in it's own sauce, they simply poured on the tomato garlic bisque that we had already ordered as a first course. After reading mixed reviews about this place, I was pleasantly surprised, This place was a hot mess with slightly cold food, but I really liked it.

Great light combination and not too heavy. The size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish. To top it off we had the rice pudding dessert which was similar to flan but I thought this was so tasty. I kind of want one right now as I am typing this review.

[92mShopping[0m at Whole Foods this afternoon made us hungry and as we had no plans for dinner, my wife thought of Cafe Zinho, which is nearby. I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly, they had an open table for us. Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one. We made a [92mquick[0m stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe, bought a Spanish red, and showed up at Cafe Zinho. They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine, and [92mbrought[0m over two nice stems. The waiter gave us menus, described the [92mdaily[0m [92mspecials[0m and gave us time to mull it over. We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked). Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread. It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly. The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious (and filling) cream soup. After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees. My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go. She was quite pleased with it. It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette. I had a taste and agreed with her assessment. My lamb burger was huge! It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney. It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger. Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger! I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium. It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices. My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy! I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room. My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up. We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us. It was a very nice meal and dining experience. We noticed that the hostess greeted most people who came thru he door by name. Obviously there are a large group of regulars who dine here often. Pros: BYOB, tasty food, reasonable noise level, outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally, friendly and attentive service (if a bit unpolished). Cons: Ambience (it originally was a gas station) and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor, tables are packed every which way into the available interior space.

This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. [91mParking[0m in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to [91mimpossible[0m on a busy [91mSaturday[0m [91mnight[0m; the [91mdiner[0m should be [91mprepared[0m to [91mwalk[0m a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park. The [91mgreatest[0m [91mdrawback[0m is that the restaurant is [91mtiny[0m and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which [91mhappened[0m repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery. No other table offered a much [91mbetter[0m [91msituation[0m and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night. There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli. Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did. The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner. A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter. My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces. I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup. All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions. All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server: "chicken maputo Roasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce". Does the average diner know what "maputo" and "piri piri" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream. It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories. The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon. I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant. Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town. The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity. It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site. I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only. Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine. If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us. I posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check. An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out. He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden. Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine. He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense. I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough. I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.

No other table offered a much [92mbestest[0m [92mcircumstance[0m and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night. There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli. Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did. The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner. A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter. My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces. I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup. All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions. All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server: "chicken maputo Roasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce". Does the average diner know what "maputo" and "piri piri" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream. It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories. The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon. I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant. Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town. The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity. It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site. I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only. Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine. If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us. I posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check. An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out. He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden. Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine. He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense. I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough. I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.

Nevertheless, I had a great experience and would happily encourage any of the Art museum visitors to head over and take the tour.

I recently had semi-permanent lashes put on for my wedding at the WEXFORD Izzazu salon. Upon completion, I thought they looked a bit odd, but figured I just wasn't used to them yet. The next day was my wedding day, and my bridesmaids and I got our hair and makeup done at the downtown Izzazu salon. The makeup artist (who was great) said they looked terrible (which they did- they were uneven and there was white glue all over them) and had to remove them and reapply. They are supposed to last 2 weeks, so removing them the next morning was very [91munpleasant[0m and I ended up [91mlosing[0m a [91mton[0m of my [91mreal[0m lashes when everything was said and done.

Considering my [92mabsolute[0m love for sweets - and more specifically, ice cream - it just doesn't make sense that it took me nearly 6 years of living in Pittsburgh to go to Page Dairy Mart. The only [92mbad[0m [92mthing[0m is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof now. As you walk up, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, right? The people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That "line" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears. A night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and I haven't wanted to go back. Only our conscious willpower has kept us away, and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way, so kudos to Page Dairy Mart and their staff! Heck, it's snowing today, and I'm probably going to go!

I do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able to find a great white. The salmon carpaccio last night is the best I've ever had. The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent. I don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra). In my original post I said it was a bit pricey, but I've decided it's well worth the cost now. I also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world. There's definitely a lot more to have at this italian place than just pasta and red sauce.
I gotta give my man Jonathan kudos for some recent changes he's [91mapplying[0m. The upstairs now has a [91mmenus[0m with smaller lighter items for the bar.

Steve and Clint are [91madequate[0m [91mfreshly[0m additions as server and bartender. This is only my [91msecondly[0m 5 [91mstars[0m review, probably should deserve 4.5, but wtf it's so obvious he cares and [91madmits[0m the business so much. The food is still [91mbig[0m, the patio is nice, the hood' location is still scary and fun and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated. I do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able to find a great white. The salmon carpaccio last night is the best I've ever had. The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent. I don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra).

I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had. Onto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy. Salad course: Great salad! Pasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel... For the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much. I could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. I really cannot wait to go again.

[92mIncredible[0m [92mexperience[0m up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons.

Sicilian, so folks who are not [92mfamiliar[0m should take look at their menu online before coming because it [92mmight[0m catch you off guard, it isn't what the "normal" Italian restaurant offers. I had a [92mgreat[0m [92mexperience[0m [92mdodging[0m potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it [92mtakes[0m the stress out of trying to find parking. Upon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The "Holy Oil" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite. Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. Then be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner. I then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review. I did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork. I wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!

The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. Then be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner. I then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review. I did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork. I wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!

TOTALLY one of the [92mbest[0m restaurants in Pittsburgh!! Food and service was just [92mamazing[0m. The quality of the dishes was better than we had even in New York City. This is definitely a restaurant to bookmark and remember for the ages. Reminds me of the old style Italian restaurants that used to be in Bloomfield when that area was just a horrid place to go. Well, Alla Famiglia is in the Allentown area which is not a neighborhood of choice. Yes, your car is guarded in a private secure lot!! Get over the location, this is the gem of gems! Old style design in a charming old building with copper and huge fans. The kitchen is right there for you to watch and its worth watching this chef do his thing! The dishes come out hot, no waiting, the service staff is like a tag team and they all share duties to get the food to you once its ready. The quality of the food was impeccable and the 5 course presentation was really enjoyable... Oh and dessert was to die for; Belgium chocolate gelato in a fresh waffle cone and the creamiest NY cheesecake you ever had with a hint of orange zest...

After hearing about AF and reading the reviews, I was expecting an amazing experience. We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally, D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. [92mHomey[0m, old school Italian [92mfeel[0m. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing [92mbetter[0m than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. We were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However, I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also, this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me, the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall, it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down. For the price, I have had better meals and better service at other restaurants around the city.

My boyfriend & I went to Alla Famiglia for our (late) Valentine's Day dinner last night. We don't go out & splurge like this often, so we were really [91mexcited[0m for a special dinner. The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was absolute [91mgarbage[0m. I've seriously been treated better at a TGIFriday's. We waited, pretty much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once seated, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, "UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab." It was 10:30. On a Saturday night. I don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults. When I plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around, I expect to be treated like I'm spending $160 at your restaurant. Despite how great the food was, I won't be returning. SO disappointed.

To sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery I felt neither pampered nor [91mimpressed[0m. I MIGHT have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till I got home and realized that my nails hadn't been cut short as I had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail. A week later I had to cut my own toes and ruin my all right looking pedicure. This place doesn't feel clean or inviting. The decor was junkie and old and cluttered. I will say that everyone was very friendly and they did take me right away when I walked in. I was really pulling for you, Future Nails. But sadly, I don't see you at all in my future. 1.5 Stars

The only other pizza joint that I can think of that is anything similar is Beto's over on Banksville Road in Dormont (or Greentree, where's the line?) This is take out only. No eating there guys. Also, there's not really a "small" option and all of their pizza's are square. If that's a problem, find another pizza joint! I believe they sell calzones and a few other things, but we always go for the pizza.

As a side note, their drive-thru speaker went down about a month ago and still hasn't been repaired. It creates delays at the drive-thru window for placing orders, especially later in the evening due to above mentioned cashier habits.

After doing some drinking at some other places, we landed at Park House. Load me up with some more drinks and the free popcorn and peanuts (which you can just toss the scraps on the floor). I'm sold!! The beers were [92mreasonably[0m priced and this was the type of place where you can gather with friends and just hang out. No pressure at all. The lighting wasn't too dark so it felt intimate where you were sitting. Seems like a neighborhood bar where everyone knew each other.

I have driven by this place a bunch of times and just recently realized that A: it exists, and B: it's a bar. I was encouraged to come here by the insistence of a friend who comes in enough that it's just a matter of time before he has his own personalized mug. They have a surprisingly [92mexcellent[0m beer selection, mostly micros. The drafts aren't cheap, at $5-$8 a draft but Happy Hour is from 6-8pm and is $2 off a draft. We also tried the food.

I have driven by this place a bunch of times and just recently realized that A: it exists, and B: it's a bar. I was encouraged to come here by the insistence of a friend who comes in enough that it's just a matter of time before he has his own personalized mug. They have a surprisingly [91mglamorous[0m beer selection, mostly micros. The drafts aren't cheap, at $5-$8 a draft but Happy Hour is from 6-8pm and is $2 off a draft. We also tried the food.

(In a [92mfun[0m architecture way, not a dive bar way) There was a good crowd for the music, but we were still able to get a table with a big group. As other Yelpers have pointed out, there's free popcorn and peanuts you can help yourself to. They have a small menu, but the food is good. We split an order of the hummus. YUM! A couple friends ordered some sandwiches and they looked really yummy. The beer selection is quite good, we all ordered some seasonals from various microbreweries. They do have TVs, so you are able to catch a game and grab a bite if you are in the mood. We had a server who was efficient despite being slammed once the music started. I give her mad props, b/c I was not without a beer throughout the entire set. That scores major points in my book. I noted that people also seemed to be getting drinks at the bar timely as well. All in all The Park House is a decent spot to hangout! I will definitely be back!!

I had heard a lot about their food and decided to check it out one night after purchasing a Groupon. This review is strictly for the [91mfood[0m. It was not [91mgood[0m. The hummus was okay, and our main plate [91mseemed[0m to be microwaved. The bar ambiance seemed cool though. So if you are looking for a bar atmosphere, I'd probably rate this 3.5 stars. For dinner, not that great.

It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. The brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). The food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT. A really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly).

Let me start off by saying that I am unfamiliar with German food. I cannot [92mcompare[0m what I had with what is served in Germany, but I will describe my experience. I ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with [92mmini[0m shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a [92mvariety[0m of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, [92mbratwurst[0m, and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was good but doesn't do well as a leftover. My dessert consisted of German chocolate cake. I know, I know...how original. BUT I LOVE GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! And yes, I do know that German chocolate was created in America by a man with the last name of German...STILL LOVE IT!!!

Let me start off by saying that I am unfamiliar with German food. I cannot [91mcompares[0m what I had with what is served in Germany, but I will describe my experience. I ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with [91mminuscule[0m shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a [91mmultiple[0m of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, [91mweenie[0m, and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal.

It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items. I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it. Sadly, I just didn't like it. I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all. I know, I know, this is like "world famous" goulash, but I was NOT into it! What I was into was the German Potato Salad. I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh. This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce. Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all! Would I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own. Oh well, on to the next one right?

I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good. Sunday brunch A neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find. So, for dinner and lunch my original 2 stars stand but the Sunday brunch is a solid 4 1/2 stars.

The sauasages of all varieties have been great. The weinerschnitzel also great. Sandwiches all good as well. I also don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though. Sides- I love love love their sides. I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes. Don't pass the sides up! Dessert: Also love their desserts. There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR. Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well. Besides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient. There is also ample street parking, which is really nice. Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.

Sides- I love love love their sides. I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes. Don't pass the sides up! Dessert: Also love their desserts. There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR. Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well. Besides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient. There is also ample street parking, which is really nice. Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.

Max's was good, but I've had better. The restaurant is located in a tired part of town. It isn't in a [91mbad[0m area, but I'm not sure how I would feel eating there after dark. When you walk in you walk through the tavern portion of the restaurant, which is dark and gloomy. We were escorted to the rear of the tavern, which is covered in B&W pictures from the 40's, which gives it a old world [91mtired[0m feeling. The menu choices were [91mstandard[0m faire for a true german restaurant. I had Max's Goulash, which said it came with spaetzle, but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side, which was okay. The goulash was too vinegary for my tastes, but it was okay.

This place has the [92mbest[0m beef lo mien I have tasted in Pittsburgh. They cook to order so your food is fresh and isn't sitting out under a heat lamp. My friend says the hot and sour soup here is the best she's tasted as well. I like their pork egg roll but it is pretty different from others. It is mainly vegetable (Cabbage I believe) and pork. Their egg drop soup is pretty decent. I can't say I am impressed with their other dishes. I've had curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken soup, shrimp egg roll. They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien. The chicken soup was horrible. It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles. Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places. They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them. The obvious bad thing about this place is it is in a ghetto neighborhood. It is probably not worth making a trip out there but if you're in the neighborhood, I'd say give it a try. They're cheap and they give you tons of food. It is cook to order so wait time might be a little long. You can call in and order as well. Not everything on the menu is the best but they have a huge menu to choose from.

I really [91mwanted[0m to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful. We found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway. I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel. Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood. For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle. Priory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role.

The elevator is great. The bar was nice - small, but a great place to stop for a nightcap on your way back in for the evening. I had made some specific request - away from the elevator, not facing the street, etc. - they fulfilled all of them. I love it when a hotel pays attention! We would absolutely recommend The Priory!

We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the [91mworst[0m [91mspots[0m in the [91mcity[0m!). The hotel is located across the [91mstreet[0m from a [91mhousing[0m [91mauthority[0m building. [91mProjects[0m? UGH. Great. Then we were put into a "historical" [91mroom[0m that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, [91mmoldy[0m [91mthreadbare[0m carpeting, [91mlumpy[0m squeaky bed. I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated. I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course. About 50% more expensive. But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old "historical" creepy room. Finally, a regular room-- the "renovated" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room. Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room? Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? I slept well in the "new" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable. The bathroom was nice and clean. The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else. The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all. I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh. I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever. What is money except a means to be comfortable and live? I will spend more next time. Breakfast was "eh". It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items: sausage + bacon. OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available. Honestly, I felt like I was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here...

The hotel is located across the [92mroad[0m from a [92mhouse[0m [92mauthorised[0m building. [92mProject[0m? UGH. Great. Then we were put into a "historical" [92mchamber[0m that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, [92mdecadent[0m [92mmangy[0m carpeting, [92mlump[0m squeaky bed. I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated. I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course. About 50% more expensive. But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old "historical" creepy room. Finally, a regular room-- the "renovated" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room. Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room? Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? I slept well in the "new" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable. The bathroom was nice and clean. The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else. The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all. I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh. I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever. What is money except a means to be comfortable and live? I will spend more next time. Breakfast was "eh". It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items: sausage + bacon. OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available. Honestly, I felt like I was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here...

We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory [91mearlier[0m this [91mmonth[0m. My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night. With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant. When my husband called the Priory, they [91msaid[0m they would make the reservations and call us back on the time. We [91mnever[0m got a call about the reservation time which was annoying. But the [91mmain[0m issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this [91mreservation[0m at [91mMeat[0m and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle. We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they made our reservation. We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes. We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out. We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it. Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager. She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel. We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this. He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill. It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory. This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.

The massive screen added a layer of epic to the film viewing experience that in no way could be matched by any other theater around town. Tickets for movies at the Omnimax can be purchased separately from the general admission pass to the museum. I recall ticket prices for shows being any where for $9-$12.00. Bonus it's all set up like a movie theater and is accompanied by a concession stand that serves ICEEs. I would not suggest it for very little kids under 5 , the sound is very loud and can prove to be frightening and over whelming. I learned this the hard way.

The natural history museum, on the other hand, was full of kids of all ages running around among the dinosaur skeletons. I spent less time wandering the exhibits of gemstones and preserved animals than I had spent with the art, but still recommend checking out the badass dioramas of North American and African wildlife. Overall, a worthwhile diversion on a larger scale than you'd expect in a city Pittsburgh's size, with a bonus museum in the price of your ticket.

Cons: -Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions. -Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd. It's kinda like a diner...with bare tables...and carpet...and a few random pictures on the wall. -No booze, beer or wine. It is BYO, but I didn't see the corkage fees listed on their menu. Overall, a solid place for homecooked Italian eats. I would sprint back to Legends just for that ravioli! Mangia!

That said, allow me to jump into some of the minuses: Beans and Greens appetizer - I love beans and greens, but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added. Actually, I don't think it was garlic...I believe it was garlic salt (a huge no-no) Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, but there was so much that it killed a simple, rustic dish. Blackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded. The restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence. Unfortunately, Legends just didn't do it for me. Would I go back? Most likely not. There are far too many other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I would like to give a try.

Its okay, but it was just [91mok[0m. There's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard. We were expecting that would be for the table. We started with the polenta and the mozzarella. The mozzarella was [91munremarkable[0m, deep friend mozzarella in breading. Of course it was good, it is fried cheese! But it was [91mnothing[0m special. The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious. They give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil. This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me. Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary. My friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it. I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright. It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent. Overall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana.

Never mind the people hanging out out front and in the parking lot, who cares. What I'm truly concerned about is the vast discrepancy between this store and very [92mnearer[0m all of the other Giant Eagle locations in the Pittsburgh area. One would assume that there would be some quality control within their chain of stores. Truly [92mtriste[0m that the North [92mLado[0m has so few [92mpossibilities[0m at which to [92mboutique[0m for reasonably priced, fresh food.

Once inside, you have to find a cart that has all 4 wheels, travels in a straight line, doesn't make squeeky noises, and isn't wet or filled with trash. Then go to the produce department. Whenever I go to the produce [91mdepartment[0m of any other grocer, I [91mnotice[0m some of the produce has fallen on the floor, and some has rolled under the shelves. I'm almost positive that this produce is collected and sent to the Cedar ave Giant Eagle. This store is not clean. To its credit, they still have people who bag groceries for you, and the staff are decent, especially considering the demoralizing nature of their work environment. The location is also very good. If the Cedar Ave Giant Eagle wants to improve, it needs to hire security to keep the parking lot clear of panhandlers, get new shopping carts, get rid of the self-checkout registers, improve their produce department, and have an overnight cleaning team. Until then, they will keep pushing me and everyone else to shop with their competition.

This is a small, [91mfranchise[0m-owned location that caters to the predominantly low income households in the area. Selection is quite limited throughout the store with limited quantities on the shelf of the items they do carry. Because of the area in which it is located, the store is NOT 24-hours as most Giant Eagle's seem to be. The pharmacy inside the store, unlike the store itself, is corporate owned, and it's staff is friendly and efficient. A stark contrast to the rest of the store. Once again reflecting the relatively low income of the area this store serves, there will be one of more jitney's (unlicensed cabs, effectively) waiting outside the store willing to take you and your groceries home for a small fee. In general, if you CAN shop somewhere else, you will probably want to.
