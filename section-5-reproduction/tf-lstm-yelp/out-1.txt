My aunt was right, you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!!

When I [92mlived[0m in Los Angeles a year and a half ago, P F Chang's was no great shakes, one of millions of places with [92mgood[0m but not outstanding stuff on the menu. Here in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines genuinely [92mgood[0m service with quality food. Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here. The Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with [92mdelicious[0m fried chicken cubes and the [92musual[0m hot sauce and chiles. Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too. Their fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like. Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do. Portions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came. The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees. If you live in LA, forget P F Chang's. If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block. But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around.

REDO! I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT [91mpleased[0m with the [91mfood[0m that was presented to me. My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food. My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American [91mfood[0m with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat. So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American [91mfood[0m in this [91mcaricature[0m of a Chinese restaurant. There were very few people in the restaurant. The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and [91mleft[0m to [91mreview[0m our menus. When our waitress [91mfinally[0m arrived we ordered the following items: [91mCoca[0m [91mCola[0m Iced Tea Pan fried pork dumplings Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup Changs chicken with white rice Our drinks and my soup came out immediately. Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything. I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table. I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table. I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know. Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was. I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye. My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils. The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself. I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown. I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server. It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow. I saw no reason to continue. I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them. The skins were a bit thick and doughy. The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all. The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off. I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid. We finished our dumplings. Our lunch entrees arrived. I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best. The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else. I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified. This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken. Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place. It is always different. Many of them are good in different ways. This food, though, it wasn't good. Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar. I just don't understand how anyone can like this place. Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.

I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating). After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables. What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them? The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price. We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.

He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died. Obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.

My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang's and stay on a vegan diet. Vegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu. Warning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as [92mdelicious[0m and the chicken. They also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables. I always loved the fact PF Chang's offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so well with their meals. The service staff at Chang's is always top shelf, I've never had a bad time here and love when we go.

So I have never been to P.F.

My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. We came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.

I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely [92mpersonable[0m and [92mfast[0m. The food is typical PF Chang's: [92mdelicious[0m. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of "Chinese" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entr\u00e9es and have never been disappointed. I've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones. The only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang's, included.

Once you go Pei Wei, you never go.... PF Chang's (if you can help it). Pei Wei is Chang's super convenient and cost friendly fast casual eatery that started infiltrating the Detroit market in 2007. Subsequently, that was the last time I stepped into a PF Changs until I recently moved back to Pittsburgh. Going from a Pei Wei to a PF Chang's is like watching paint dry or sitting in rush hour traffic or attending a WNBA game; it's so [92mmethodical[0m and time consuming. On our last visit to this location we were accidentally sat in a section in which the server had been cut from his/her shift. By the time we flagged down a server and everything was sorted out, we could have been halfway through our meals at Pei Wei. Add in the wait time for a table, the sauces shtick, and presentation of the check and my head's about to explode. Chang's is more paced for retires and people on dates, not my lifestyle. I get it, it's a me problem. With that said, the staff is very nice and helpful at this location (star). I can get a beer or alcoholic beverage while I wait (something that's not an option at Pei Wei) (star). Plymouth Gin is stocked behind the bar - that's a chain first! (star). I found a dish I love not available at Pei Wei - Salt and Pepper Prawns (star). So until I get sick of the Prawns or a Pei Wei opens in the Pittsburgh market, I'll continue to go to this location.

Going from a Pei Wei to a PF Chang's is like watching paint dry or sitting in rush hour traffic or attending a WNBA game; it's so [91msystematic[0m and time consuming. On our last visit to this location we were accidentally sat in a section in which the server had been cut from his/her shift. By the time we flagged down a server and everything was sorted out, we could have been halfway through our meals at Pei Wei. Add in the wait time for a table, the sauces shtick, and presentation of the check and my head's about to explode. Chang's is more paced for retires and people on dates, not my lifestyle. I get it, it's a me problem. With that said, the staff is very nice and helpful at this location (star). I can get a beer or alcoholic beverage while I wait (something that's not an option at Pei Wei) (star). Plymouth Gin is stocked behind the bar - that's a chain first! (star). I found a dish I love not available at Pei Wei - Salt and Pepper Prawns (star). So until I get sick of the Prawns or a Pei Wei opens in the Pittsburgh market, I'll continue to go to this location.

We had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was [92mmuch[0m [92mimproved[0m. There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. Our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. I appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu. I still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy.

Let me start off by [91msaying[0m I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new. So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be. I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two "pork"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh. Next came my "lunch-portion" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes. Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all. I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The "lunch-portion" cost was $9.95. At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip. The service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.

Not knowing, nor doing my homework before I showed up, I asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not. Not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included. After looking through it for a few minutes I was able to select the bread I wanted. They will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now. If you would rather slice yourself, I am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way. Yes, it's true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf. But it is much better tasting.

In addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most Targets, this location also has an optical department. Of the 10-15 locations in the Pittsburgh area, only this store and the Cranberry store sell glasses. I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through Target Optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service.

Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits. Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding. 1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call. The other groomsmen and I had to follow up [91mrepeatedly[0m to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very [91mshort[0m with our honest questions over the phone. 2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting. 3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said "Oh... I don't know" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say "Let me check that for you") he instead said "Well, I'm going to hang up now." And he made good on that promise, and hung up. 4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to. 5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know. Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect. 6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white. Another received no studs. We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization. 7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate "I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?" to which she responded "Yeah that should be fine" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard. 8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when he informed her of said late fee. 9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse. Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it. Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told "Oh, that isn't for this. That is intended for YOUR wedding. Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year." 10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion. He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it. When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use. Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week. Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was "Effing Men's Wearhouse." For example, at a restaurant, "Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!" "Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse." Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me "I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding" to which I replied "Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA" Congrats Men's Wearhouse. You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits. TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.

The food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell's at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.

With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest. The chef should do so. (He's a nice guy like me I hope.) BBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer. It is chilled, very delicious. This appetizer was recommended and was garbage. The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate. Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce. A real "must-miss". Cod entree was OK. The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans. Potato skin had grit in the mashed. Why 1 star? The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine.

This was my first time at this location. I've frequented the Upper St Clair Galleria restaurant. There's a lot to like about this Columbus OH based chain. I don't usually eat at chain restaurants nor will I review them because they're typically big food corporate run places that don't care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders. This place seems different to me. The food quality and care seems to be very high. The staff is [92malways[0m well trained. I like the decor and ambiance. The menu offers many options. I don't really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall I am a fan. I do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here. I like to buy the trout and prepare it at home. We were here for a Thanksgiving meet-up event with 69 other people. The room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall. It's a tough thing to do. It wasn't perfect for sure but the food was surprisingly good and came out hot and fresh. Nicely done.

I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. With that said, this is probably the [91mworst[0m Dick's location that I've ever been to. The selection is very [91mlimited[0m for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the [91mlack[0m of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players. The staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it's the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don't have what we're looking for). They do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a "good" Dick's location.

It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took. While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly. The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot. Everyone in the table resented me for "holding back" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger. Which hey works as a segway onto the burger. Quesadilla Burger. I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways. The patty was sorta flavorful. The toppings were in the [91mbland[0m category. Cheese went MIA. And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless. A big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits.

I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza. My fiance, a friend and I were [91mtrying[0m pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them. I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area. Whenever I called to place my order I was [91mtold[0m that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I arrived closer to 30 minutes [91mlater[0m and was immediately [91mconfused[0m whenever I walked into the [91mrestaurant[0m. You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from. Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there. My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me "Stay out of trouble". I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else. The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it. The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy. Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening. The bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future. I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.

It is not Sesame Inn or China Palace; it is not a "date night out" sort of place. It most definitely is a cozy, inexpensive, good quality "stay in and relax" go to. Hope this helps!

We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.

There were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. The service was great. All in all it was an amazing experience. The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it . This is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and it is very private.Not to dressy and not too casual. Pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown.

Without question, this is my [92mfavorite[0m thrift [92mstore[0m in the greater Pittsburgh region. I find antique kitchenwares here that are older than my grandma, worth $85 if the antique mall is to be believed, and priced at $2.50. The 50%-off [92msales[0m [92mactually[0m pay off here. The merchandise [92mturns[0m over [92mquickly[0m. The staff is a [92mreal[0m cast of characters (don't [92mmiss[0m the steelers tattoos!!! i'm seriously serious, they are [92mamazing[0m). there are bicycles for you and your kids in decent-semi-working condition. The balance of stuff is about half and half valuable old vintage and more modern hand-me-downs. The prices are reasonable to cheap. The plastic bags on the wall are often a treasure trove. The kitchen section could outfit your kitchen in fondue pots for days. Most thrift store remodels result in ridiculous high prices to pay for the construction. The remodel here just means a bigger, cleaner store and parking lot. I have spent, cumulatively, probably several weeks of my life in this store. This is, hands-down, without question, the thing I miss most about leaving Pittsburgh. This store is the largest single contributor to my wardrobe, outside of H&M.

The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited. The clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. Shopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner.

I went there for breakfast AND everyone in our group left sated!! As always I had my kid carnivores in tow, and as is their custom they laid waste to EVERYTHING edible that was put before them. While they are a TAD (and I do mean tad) bit pricey I believe that the food is more than worth it. The clientele (what I can only believe are Bellevue regulars) are polite and inviting. My breakfast was made well, tasted [91mmassive[0m, and dressed pretty as a picture. I will tell you this is not my first rusty nail rodeo and lord willing it will not be my last.

This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all. When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables. One almost hit our child. Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there. The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired. Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby. Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush. We will not be back. Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card????? Please get up with the times.

I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace. Bad idea. My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and "Italian frites." The latter, which the menu described as "fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic," were [91mbasically[0m just regular-ass french fries - [91mdecent[0m, but [91mnowhere[0m [91mnear[0m [91mworth[0m their $6 price tag. The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce. Talk about a profit margin! As a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper. It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers. Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a "nice" restaurant? Classless. Conclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's.

The latter, which the menu described as "fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic," were [92mimportantly[0m just regular-ass french fries - [92mallright[0m, but [92msomewhere[0m [92maround[0m [92mworthy[0m their $6 price tag. The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce. Talk about a profit margin! As a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper. It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers. Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a "nice" restaurant? Classless. Conclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's.

Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a [91mnouveau[0m-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the [91mmenu[0m is [91muninspired[0m and predictable.

Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street.

I [92mwent[0m to Pino's to [92mcelebrate[0m a friends birthday on a Thursday night. I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful. We made [92mreservations[0m, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in. My two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so [92mnaturally[0m we order one of everything that looks good. We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella. This was an [92mimpressive[0m [92mway[0m to start out the meal. We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer. This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny. The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order. It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish. I ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it. I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night. Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable. My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce. Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on. Talk about service! The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5. Added bonus: Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen. Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).

We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well. Overall, I would definitely recommend Pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in Point Breeze. However, I wish they offered the 3 course menu as a regular feature.

We tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse. I don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there.

I live in Connecticut and visit family in Pittsburgh often. Pino's is my [92mfavorite[0m Pittsburgh restaurant. I don't have one favorite dish because I usually order one of the specials, which change often. I ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (I think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as [92mgood[0m as what I had in Italy. My son had the seafood risotto. It was so [92mgood[0m, I need to order it next time. My brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. He loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). He was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time. Oh, they also make great cocktails and have a very, very nice wine list. Oh, if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the Belgium place around the corner, try Pino's. The fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum! No, it isn't cheap. But, I'm happy to pay for quality.

This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to [91mever[0m go again. I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said "dish looks beautiful." He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious, which it usually is The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy. The best part? He comes out again and says "I really enjoyed the steak you sent back." He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up! At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said "it's not my job to make people happy" that's strange considering he wants our business. So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave. I couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad. Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers. Sorry, we will never step foot in here again.

After my visit last night, I have no desire to [92mpermanently[0m go again. I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said "dish looks beautiful." He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious, which it usually is The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy. The best part? He comes out again and says "I really enjoyed the steak you sent back." He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up! At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said "it's not my job to make people happy" that's strange considering he wants our business. So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave. I couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad. Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers. Sorry, we will never step foot in here again.

I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. It's just as [91moverpriced[0m and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy, but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things, hopefully not produce. Parking is easy and you can hit up the unpretentious Wine and Spirits in the same stop. I think this plaza still exists to prevent impoverished people from venturing into the other newer fancier stores which are a mere half mile away and designed to appeal to people who think they are cultured and discerning.

By the time we got it home it was like eating a lunch meat sandwich. Still delicious but I would have like a little more bite in my hoagie. The interior is a little outdated but they have a bunch of steeler memorabilia hanging up. Also, if you like to play the lottery they have a small window for buying and playing the numbers. Waste of money if you ask me but to each his own. BTW, IT'S CASH ONLY HERE, but they do have an ATM.

I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine.

The only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service.

The only reason they only get 4 stars is my poor puppy is SO sick. We've had him for 3 weeks and he's got an awful cough that hasn't been responsive to any antibiotics. I know its hard to keep all the dogs isolated, but I really think 8 weeks is a little too early to neuter a puppy especially after being found in a park- too much stress! Hopefully our little guy starts getting better soon, we're awfully worried about him! Still love the ARL though!

Our poor [91mtiny[0m guy had been dumped in a park and some very [91malright[0m [91mpeople[0m [91mrendered[0m him to the ARL who took him in, waited 3 days for someone to claim him, and neutered him. He wasn't even [91mpresumed[0m to be on the floor yet when we got there, but they were super helpful and [91mlodged[0m him out to us and let us take him home. The [91mpersonnel[0m there were super helpful and [91mmagnifique[0m to my incredibly anxious fiance- imagine a first time dad bringing home the baby! The only reason they only get 4 stars is my poor puppy is SO sick. We've had him for 3 weeks and he's got an awful cough that hasn't been responsive to any antibiotics. I know its hard to keep all the dogs isolated, but I really think 8 weeks is a little too early to neuter a puppy especially after being found in a park- too much stress! Hopefully our little guy starts getting better soon, we're awfully worried about him! Still love the ARL though!

I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring. During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed [92mgenuinely[0m happy for me. Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting. A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter). I contacted the shelter and they practically bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues. The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing. In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly. Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions. I would highy suggest adopting from this shelter. I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok. The shetler staff care deeply about the animal AND the human's well-being!

I've had such good experiences with ARL, that I will probably return here again and again. Years ago we adopted a mutt of a puppy that turned out to be the best dog that I could have ever imagined. But let me talk about my most recent visit. While browsing Facebook, I noticed that they were having an event at ARL. This particular event was called the Free Fur All. The event involved [92mfree[0m adoption to qualified adopters, [92mfree[0m micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and [92mgoodies[0m for both human and furry [92mcompanions[0m. I had plans to get Little Man E microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free. Hot damn, you know I was in line. It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night. Once we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes. It's a very quick thing to have done. Little Man E didn't even flinch. He was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade. I have to give huge kudos to the staff there. They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet. It's like they talk their language. I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!). Once done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath). We visited one of the tables and E selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that. This place is amazing for so many different pet oriented things. I'll definitely be coming back here whenever I need something for LME.

Never again. Let me repeat, never again. The primary [91mreason[0m I used to visit this store was to [91mfill[0m [91mmedical[0m [91mprescriptions[0m. Due to their [91mrepeated[0m [91minability[0m and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this [91mstore[0m. Walking into the [91mstore[0m, you are given the [91mstink[0m-[91meye[0m by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy "[91mguilty[0m-until-proven guilty" feeling a shoplifter [91mwould[0m get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the [91mmouthwash[0m and shampoo. The [91mpharmacy[0m seems to be [91mstaffed[0m by [91mhigh[0m [91mschool[0m [91minterns[0m. They have no [91mconcept[0m of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy. I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for. The first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers. i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card. After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer. I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior. When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up "maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in." Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance. The latest of many "adventures" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill. We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow. Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up. I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription. But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment. We then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior. We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us. After searching around for a few minutes, they "found" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready. Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared. Hence, I am now here, writing this review. Never, ever again.

They refused to start [92msweltering[0m before mid-October and the centrally heated apartment grew very chilly as Fall progressed. On another occasion, they refused to change a rusted and weak lock. The lock eventually gave way and I locked myself into the bathroom. After the incident, I requested that the lock be changed immediately, and one of the owners threatened saying that we were in default of our lease agreement for not [92mkeep[0m our [92mappartment[0m as clean as when it had been leased to us. Dealing with Rocco and Elisabeth is [92mwondrous[0m, but good [92mchance[0m getting anything done with Nick who seems to be increasingly [92mtreat[0m the operations of Rockwel.

Do you see how all of the other reviews give this [92mplace[0m 5 [92mstars[0m - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop. I am [92mgiving[0m all 5 [92mstars[0m to this delightful coffee shop because it is the [92mperfect[0m community coffee shop. I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing. It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is [92malmost[0m full - there are [92malways[0m people coming going, getting coffee. It is a [92mgreat[0m [92mplace[0m to sit and read the paper or to [92mpick[0m up some coffee on your way to some place else. Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here. Other reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating). - free wifi - outside tables - tasty treats - they have a blog! - really great coffee - the staff are coffee experts

All that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.
