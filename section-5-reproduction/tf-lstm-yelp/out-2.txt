It was a bit out of the way of where we were staying, but I was swayed by the Yelp reviews! You did not steer me wrong. A nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood, Enrico's was the [92mperfect[0m spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed. My wife and I both got lattes and pastries, and everything was [92mgood[0m to go. It looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there, rooted to a chair. We got the next to last free table. Almost every "two-top" had only one person sitting at it. I would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes. Recommend! P.s. I thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here.

The front serves as a good Pittsburgh sports bar. It's a particularly great place to watch the Penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. There are lots of HDTV's and there is a good selection of beer. The food, however, is bland and is [91mterrible[0m bbq, even for the northeast. I would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home.

I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK. I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small. I actually liked the wing sauces I tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic). Our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive. I would probably only [91mgo[0m again on an all-you-can-eat wings night. For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was [91mOK[0m. Surprisingly, lots of vegetarian options. A vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.

Consistancy is what is delivered. Buffalo Blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics. Service is spotty, I do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when I go there. The plus is, when specific staff is working, the place is that much of a better establishment. Consistantly just above average in my opinion. I chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment. 5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues. I would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich I'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars.

I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions. We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's. The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles. I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter. It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me. For dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos. We were [91mtold[0m that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it. At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well. So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos. They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking. For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples. Upon receiving the salad I dug in. The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad. However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad. Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples. She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left. I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred. It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth. The bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good. However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again. It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.

My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty "meh" experience for me. We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought. It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area. I went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy. The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp. The sandwich left something to be [91mdesired[0m. It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich. The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy. There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor, It was just belly-filler, really. I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here. I just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8. I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8. Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem. But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home. Buffalo Blues was neither. Not particularly interested in returning for any reason.

When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on.... Food is really, [91mreally[0m average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! The ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your "space" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called "party room" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table. Want to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!! The "wonderful" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, "Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries). The food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it! This place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!

I [91mhate[0m this place. I have been here many [91mtimes[0m and I am just finally getting around to writing a review. Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she [91msaid[0m I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. Buffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The [91mservice[0m is [91mhorrendous[0m and the [91mfood[0m may be [91mbetter[0m at Hooters. The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board. My friends like going for all you can eat wing night but [91mfrankly[0m I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals. So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting. They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch. The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo. I chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice. It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless. I paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave. I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.

I have a love-hate relationship with this place... I love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding. I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays. [91mHowever[0m, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced. The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't. Not even a little bit. The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings. So, it's not really much of a win at all. Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it. So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.

I may be a little biased... this place is right down the street from my house and we go there frequently, but I think Blues is [92mgreat[0m. I have had quite a few things in the menu but two things that I [92mlove[0m more than others are the cobb salad and the Oscar's Garbage burger. The cobb salad is just a cob salad, but some how they make it better than most. I don't know if it's the sprout or the dressing, but it is one of the [92mbest[0m cobb [92msalads[0m I have ever had. And the garabge burger....Mmmmmmm. This burger caught my attenetion at first because it has an egg on it. I lovelovelove a burger with an egg on it. I don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you! But that's not all. Imagine a Primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. It has fries, cole slaw, an egg and American cheese. My BF often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. They also have a really good veggie sandwich with Hummus (I don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. Also, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and GREAT fresh homemade potato chips. Now, as far as the ribs and wings go, I'm not a big ribs/wings person. I can appreciate that they're good, but I wouldn't order it much. Having said that, my BF frequently orders one or the other and I always have my fair share of tastes. he raves about them so....If you looking for a nice place to watch a football or hockey game or just craving some good food I highly suggest it!

Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in. So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste. We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them. She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture. Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table. At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere. I think we're done here.

The amount of choice is less than just about all the Chinese Buffets that I have ever been too, but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. All the patrons here are American, so this isn't the Asian place where the Asians eat. It's very non-spicy, non-original food, but it's fresh and good tasting. I would certainly return. Giving it 7.5 Knuckles out of 11.

I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). I drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. After paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they "would work with me". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? If you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle. If you need an oil change go to Midas on Penn Circle they'll be able to get you in and not wait three days.

I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV! Why did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask. Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!! Oh, and 30 minutes? that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA.

It has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out. Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA. Oh, and if you think this is a harsh review...

A few hours before the event, we happened across the ad in the City Paper and decided to give it a shot. We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery. Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple. Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something. In the end, we chose not to spend the [91mextra[0m $15 to [91mmake[0m [91manother[0m garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball. When our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear. He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds. Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything! From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue. Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn. We then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats. The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm. The gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch. In the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!). It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals). We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item.

I have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!' I'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort. Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way. But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now. Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint. I'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.

I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will. But their pizza was remarkably [91mterrible[0m. Went there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a "personal" pie, costs $7 and is 7" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a "small," which is 10". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait. There are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench. The friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, "I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good." Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10" pizza is, and started eating. Let me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, "well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine." That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, "it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can." I ate three out of the six "slices." (One sixth of a 10" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty. Ashamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away. Went home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up. I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.

Then the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00 pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. Then there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!! Ugh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. I come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load. All in all I spent 8$ at the econowash for 2 large loads I wasn't able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that. I can do that much at Laundry Factory around the corner though. So I will be going there. I don't need a creepy dude changing my dryer settings and touching my stuff.
I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because [92ma[0m [92mlaver[0m [92mpleasure[0m [92msubmitted[0m me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs. I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience --Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. ---- [92mcheat[0m [92mheralded[0m it boasts "[92mgreatest[0m [92mcapabilities[0m" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were [92mglistening[0m in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. Then the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00 pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. Then there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!! Ugh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes.

I think the only [91mthing[0m I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers. Let's see why..... I attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot. (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home). When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back. So I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly. Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99... Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review). So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds. But then I decide to buy "fresh" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try. (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it. Gimmie my Jif.) So while I am waiting in line, I see the bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere. Regardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my "whole food". And at least I put my cart back.

[91mWorst[0m parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again.

If you google "Whole Foods deals," you'll find a whole slew of couponing blogs that tell you where to find the coupons.

I don't find their prices that outrageous compared to other stores in the area for the things I shop for. The 365 brand is a [92mgood[0m value and oh, do I love the bulk bins.

I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had [91mnothing[0m better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you. You pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the [91matrocious[0m parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it. I'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this [91mcould[0m happen to you too. Upon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot. And that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers. Tip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience.

I'll be honest, I just don't get it. When it comes to eating I do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan, organic, vegetarian, ethical, etc. If it's edible and it's within my palate's liking range then I eat it. From that perspective this place just gets [91mtwo[0m [91mstars[0m. Some items were [91mhigher[0m [91mpriced[0m but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I [91mguess[0m [91mjustify[0m it if you had to have it. But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced. So it feels like 90% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium. Their prepared meals section was marvelous, and their cut fruit section was like I had died and gone to heaven. But that's about the only two sections I probably would have been willing to open up my wallet.

I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is [91mridiculously[0m [91mhorrible[0m at this location - very [91mpoorly[0m planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium "natural" goods. Whole Foods does have [91mbetter[0m lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link!

All that I can say is WOWSA!!!!!!!!! This review is long overdue! I will state it outright that I'm very particular about my food, and I've been known to stomp my food like a brat when my heart's set on that vegan tofu burrito from the fresh pack section and it's not available. A few months ago, when this happened, I sulked at the Prepared Foods counter, and Bethany, prepared [92mfoods[0m customer service extraordinaire, flew to my rescue. She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect. Months have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me "the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. And everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative! I love Whole Foods Market of Pittsburgh! AND, for icing on the review cake, they've even begun to carry Brad's Raw Pizza Kale Chips for dogs. So my dog is satisfied, too. And it's her opinion that ultimately matters. ;) Five stars! Thank you!!!!!!!!!

I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my [92mfavorites[0m. It's a small store, but it [92mfeels[0m [92mhomey[0m and [92mcomfortable[0m. Staff: Most of the staff members are [92msuper[0m [92mfriendly[0m and [92mwilling[0m to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff [92mmember[0m begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's [92mnice[0m to treat others with respect. The cashiers here are so [92mfantastic[0m. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. Deli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! The tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. Cheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. Store Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. Whole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. P.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!
I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my [91mpreference[0m. It's a small store, but it [91mrealizes[0m [91mtellin[0m and [91mcosy[0m. Staff: Most of the staff members are [91mswell[0m [91mloveable[0m and [91meager[0m to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff [91mmembers[0m begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's [91mpleasurable[0m to treat others with respect. The cashiers here are so [91mgrandiose[0m. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. Deli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! The tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup.

Also if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container. This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!!

They're definitely kept in good condition and for an indoor facility that seems to be older in age the lighting is quite good. I did their two hour clinic on Sunday afternoon after playing a USTA match there and I can definitely say it is a great great great value. You get an excellent workout and the teacher during the clinic actually gives your pointers and provides remarks on your game. Definitely looking forward to trying out more of their clinics in the future.

In other words, this place is *huge* inside.

Chinese and Korean food, at or above my expectations. The [92mstuff[0m on the menu is good, and they're willing to put together things that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely. Kung pao tofu is my favorite so far.

I went to Casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. They use amazingly fresh and [92myummy[0m fruits and veggies. I had the house made granola which was just [92mamazing[0m! Toasty and [92msweet[0m, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. Also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the [92mbest[0m [92mway[0m :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. After the [92mgreat[0m pastry basket, my appetizer, a Bellini and a cup of coffee, I had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag ("the rest" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!) My only complaint would be how long everything took. While I love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. I go into brunch groggy, then I have coffee and yummy food, and I'm totally amped, ready to face the day! And then I get to sit. And wait. Anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now I'll know to make time the next time I go. Which is for dinner for a friends birthday. So excited!!

Can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage! We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity. They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove. Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple! I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the [92mdelicious[0m looking truffle fries! The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm. I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table... Service was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.

I was pleased to finally find a place in Pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money. I tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing I could have made the meal better myself. Not here. The food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was [92mdelicious[0m--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty! Decor is subtle and [92mgreat[0m for a date. Service was friendly and accommodating. I will most definitely return!

This is my [92mfavorite[0m Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. Gotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a "Mediterranean" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. I do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar! So pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!

I [92mstarted[0m off with [92msmoked[0m [92msalmon[0m and had the waitress [92mrecommended[0m braised [92mlamb[0m and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink. My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, [92mwild[0m [92mmushroom[0m omelet, and a glass of [92mfresh[0m orange juice. While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry [92mbasket[0m consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter. The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake. There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon. I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor. My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs. I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts. The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich. The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit. This dish itself is enough to make me a regular. I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too. Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations. Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.

I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not [91mworth[0m commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery... I made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the [91mterrible[0m bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, "the host is supposed to do that but I will..." Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. I was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. Casbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices. **Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!

We ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top. The waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it.

So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a [92mgreat[0m sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no? Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba. In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab. No overkill on the sauce. The soup was likewise good. I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience! The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality. I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price! Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!).

I could have ordered 3 of these for my entree! The polenta and the crispy brussel sprouts added a smoothness and a salty crunch. Delish. You have to try these! For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup! Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert but were presented with housemade salted carmels to end our meal. If you are looking for a place to enjoy good wine, amazing food and a pleasant atmosphere, Casbah is for you.

When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, "yes, it's a lemon and fig drink." More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. Also, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.

We started with a cheese trio with was paired well with different preserves and chutneys. We then had roasted octopus and the scallops. The scallops for me were very [92minteresting[0m and a little too sweet for my taste with the pear and lacked texural components. However the octopus has a real nice char, and was full of great well rounded flavors. For our entrees, my bf got the duck which was underseasoned, and the fat was jot rendered out correctly. The skin was also burnt. The sides and vegetbales of the dish were seasoned and cooked beautifully though. I had the lamb loin and it was perfectlh medium rare with delicious bitter greens. I honestly loved every part of my entree and the red wines we selected went well with the meal. All in all it was a delicious meal and a really nice environment. And worth the money.

The decor and music was just as unique, artistic, and beautiful as the rest of the Big Burrito hot spots. We ate in the basement, with a beautiful fully stocked glass wine cellar, under lit stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim. Casbah isn't cheap, but I'd still consider it once of the best values in the city because you get so much for your money. I'd trust Casbah to celebrate any special event with a flawless dining experience.

While the coffee is [92mgreat[0m, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not. In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life... braised [92mlamb[0m on [92mgrilled[0m sourdough. The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good... seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair. However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.

The last time I was at Casbah was on a balmy spring evening in my sophomore year of college. I'd arranged a dinner with my mother in a fancy effort to spring the news on her that I wanted to move out of my college dorm the following year and into a co-ed fraternity house. I remember being underwhelmed by the food, but that could've been the chilly reception with which I was met during this particular dinner and the conversation that entailed. [92mFast[0m forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws. We [92menjoyed[0m the prix-fixe brunch, and [92menjoy[0m it we did! The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits. The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry. Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time? I dare. The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon. The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over. My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage). In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without. A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries. My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Everyone left smiling and satisfied. So, if you haven't given Casbah a try in the last decade, it might be time to visit again. I'm so very glad I did! P.S. Bring your coat into the restroom. It was about 10 below in there. Brrr!

Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm. It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. I immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. I started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was [91mok[0m. For the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage. For the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok. The cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. Lastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. Service was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. This place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price.

While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today. When my [91mfood[0m came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. First off, it was not [91meven[0m [91mwarm[0m, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially). Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed. in my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. I'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. For me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!

At this time, I have officially had every meal of the day at Casbah (it's great!). Here are my thoughts from my three visits: First time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was [92mpleasant[0m even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the [92mfilet[0m [92mmignon[0m. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The [92mfilet[0m [92mmignon[0m was [92mperfection[0m. I [92mmade[0m BF [92mshare[0m with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday. Second time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal! Third time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014) . I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice. All in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons!

I do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things). They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout. Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture. Usually good music acts here. Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends. Usually 2-3 acts play. Live. And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close. And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music. The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse. I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that. Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there). Sometimes a minimal cover for the music. There are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.

The customers seem to be a nice mix between students, locals, and artists. This isn't an art museum--it's a vegetarian cafe that makes food and drink. And it does a pretty fucking good job of it.

And the milkshakes are always a good time, even if they're a bit on the expensive side. Cash-only if total is under $10. Contrary to what some others have said, this isn't a hipster hangout. The customers seem to be a nice mix between students, locals, and artists. This isn't an art museum--it's a vegetarian cafe that makes food and drink. And it does a pretty fucking good job of it.

To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.) The apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. My panini included granny smith apples, apple butter, sharp cheddar, cream cheese, and seisage (vegetarian sausage) atop sun-dried tomato bread (though it seemed more like raisin to me). Never in a million years would I have come up with this strange combination of flavors, but it definitely worked. As described in the menu, indeed it was "highly addictive". Table service was great, nothing took too long and it seemed pleasant and casual. No overbearing waiters, no frills, etc. Given the fact that I live about a mile away, I think they should be expecting yet another regular in the very near future.

Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on! Maybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the "firesticks" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake. We had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead.

To be fair, our assigned server was very nice. She was friendly and approachable. But of course, our food came and mine was cold. The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread. Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served. I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives. Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food. It just wasn't anything special. Definitely not worth $12 for brunch. Needless to say, I will not be coming back to this place.

Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable.

We [91mthink[0m the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.
